  abstract = {Many practicing biologists accept that nothing in their discipline makes sense except in the light of evolution, and that natural selection is evolution's principal sense-maker. But what natural selection actually is (a force or a statistical outcome, for example) and the levels of the biological hierarchy (genes, organisms, species, or even ecosystems) at which it operates directly are still actively disputed among philosophers and theoretical biologists. Most formulations of evolution by natural selection emphasize the differential reproduction of entities at one or the other of these levels. Some also recognize differential persistence, but in either case the focus is on lineages of material things: even species can be thought of as spatiotemporally restricted, if dispersed, physical beings. Few consider\textemdash{}as ``units of selection'' in their own right\textemdash{}the processes implemented by genes, cells, species, or communities. ``It's the song not the singer'' (ITSNTS) theory does that, also claiming that evolution by natural selection of processes is more easily understood and explained as differential persistence than as differential reproduction. ITSNTS was formulated as a response to the observation that the collective functions of microbial communities (the songs) are more stably conserved and ecologically relevant than are the taxa that implement them (the singers). It aims to serve as a useful corrective to claims that ``holobionts'' (microbes and their animal or plant hosts) are aggregate ``units of selection,'' claims that often conflate meanings of that latter term. But ITSNS also seems broadly applicable, for example, to the evolution of global biogeochemical cycles and the definition of ecosystem function.},

  volume = {4},
  issn = {1365-2486},
  abstract = {Global change can affect soil processes by either altering the functioning of existing organisms or by restructuring the community, modifying the fundamental physiologies that drive biogeochemical processes. Thus, not only might process rates change, but the controls over them might also change. Moreover, previously insignificant processes could become important. These possibilities raise the question `Will changes in climate and land use restructure microbial communities in a way that will alter trace gas fluxes from an ecosystem?' Process studies indicate that microbial community structure can influence trace gas dynamics at a large scale. For example, soil respiration and CH4 production both show ranges of temperature response among ecosystems, indicating differences in the microbial communities responsible. There are three patterns of NH4+ inhibition of CH4 oxidation at the ecosystem scale: no inhibition, immediate inhibition, and delayed inhibition; these are associated with different CH4 oxidizer communities. Thus, it is possible that changes in climate, land-use, and disturbance regimes could alter microbial communities in ways that would substantially alter trace gas fluxes; we discuss the data supporting this conclusion. We also discuss approaches to developing research linking microbial community structure and activity to the structure and functioning of the whole ecosystem. Modern techniques allow us to identify active organisms even if they have not been cultivated; in combination with traditional experimental approaches we should be able to identify the linkages between these active populations and the processes they carry out at the ecosystem level. Finally, we describe scenarios of how global change could alter trace gas fluxes by altering microbial communities and how understanding the microbial community dynamics could improve our ability to predict future trace gas fluxes.},

  abstract = {.To investigate the potential role of microbial community composition in soil carbon and nitrogen cycling, we transplanted soil cores between a grassland and a conifer ecosystem in the Sierra Nevada California and measured soil process rates (N-mineralization, nitrous oxide and carbondioxide flux, nitrification potential), soil water and temperature, and microbial community parameters (PLFA and substrate utilization profiles) over a 2 year period. Our goal was to assess whether microbial community composition could be related to soil process rates independent of soil temperature and water content. We performed multiple regression analyses using microbial community parameters and soil water and temperature as X-variables and soil process rates and inorganic N concentrations as Y-variables. We found that field soil temperature had the strongest relationship with CO2 production and soil NH4+ concentration, while microbial community characteristics correlated with N2O production, nitrification potential, gross N-mineralization, and soil NO3- concentration, independent of environmentalcontrollers. We observed a relationship between specific components of the microbial community (as determined by PLFA) and soil processes,particularly processes tightly linked to microbial phylogeny (e.g. nitrification). The most apparent change in microbial community composition in response to the 2 year transplant was a change in relative abundance of fungi (there was only one significant change in PLFA biomarkers for bacteria during 2 years). The relationship between microbial community composition and soil processes suggests that prediction of ecosystem response to environmental change may be improved by recognizing and accounting for changes in microbial community composition and physiological ecology.},

  abstract = {A critical assumption underlying terrestrial ecosystem models is that soil microbial communities, when placed in a common environment, will function in an identical manner regardless of the composition of that community. Given high species diversity in microbial communities and the ability of microbes to adapt rapidly to new conditions, this assumption of functional redundancy seems plausible. We test the assumption by comparing litter decomposition rates in experimental microcosms inoculated with distinct microbial communities. We find that rates of carbon dioxide production from litter decomposition were dependent upon the microbial inoculum, with differences in the microbial community alone accounting for substantial ({$\sim$}20\%) variation in total carbon mineralized. Communities that shared a common history with a given foliar litter exhibited higher decomposition rates when compared to communities foreign to that habitat. Our results suggest that the implicit assumption in ecosystem models (i.e., microbial communities in the same environment are functionally equivalent) is incorrect. To predict accurately how biogeochemical processes will respond to global change may require consideration of the community composition and/or adaptation of microbial communities to past resource environments.},

  abstract = {Soil microbial communities mediate critical ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycles. How microbial communities will respond to changes in vegetation and climate, however, are not well understood. We reciprocally transplanted soil cores from under oak canopies and adjacent open grasslands in a California oak\textendash{}grassland ecosystem to determine how microbial communities respond to changes in the soil environment and the potential consequences for the cycling of carbon. Every 3 months for up to 2 years, we monitored microbial community composition using phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA), microbial biomass, respiration rates, microbial enzyme activities, and the activity of microbial groups by quantifying 13C uptake from a universal substrate (pyruvate) into PLFA biomarkers. Soil in the open grassland experienced higher maximum temperatures and lower soil water content than soil under the oak canopies. Soil microbial communities in soil under oak canopies were more sensitive to environmental change than those in adjacent soil from the open grassland. Oak canopy soil communities changed rapidly when cores were transplanted into the open grassland soil environment, but grassland soil communities did not change when transplanted into the oak canopy environment. Similarly, microbial biomass, enzyme activities, and microbial respiration decreased when microbial communities were transplanted from the oak canopy soils to the grassland environment, but not when the grassland communities were transplanted to the oak canopy environment. These data support the hypothesis that microbial community composition and function is altered when microbes are exposed to new extremes in environmental conditions; that is, environmental conditions outside of their ``life history'' envelopes.},

Although still unresolved, these problems are well studied in macro-ecology (the ecology of non-microbes) and are reiterated here as an historical precautionary for microbial ecologists. Beyond expected and unresolved terminological vagueness, we argue that assessments and comparisons of taxonomic and functional profiles in micro-ecology suffer from theoretically unresolvable arbitrariness and ambiguities. We divide these into problems of scale, individuation, and commensurability. We argue that there is no technically/theoretically ``correct'' scale, individuation, or comparison of taxonomy and function, but there are nonetheless better and worse methodologies for profiling.},

  abstract = {The terrestrial biosphere plays an important role in the global carbon cycle. In the 1994 Intergovernmental Panel Assessment on Climate Change (IPCC), an effort was made to improve the quantification of terrestrial exchanges and potential feedbacks from climate, changing CO2, and other factors; this paper presents the key results from that assessment, together with expanded discussion. The carbon cycle is the fluxes of carbon among four main reservoirs: fossil carbon, the atmosphere, the oceans, and the terrestrial biosphere. Emissions of fossil carbon during the 1980s averaged 5.5 Gt y-1. During the same period, the atmosphere gained 3.2 Gt C y-1 and the oceans are believed to have absorbed 2.0 Gt C y-1. The regrowing forests of the Northern Hemisphere may have absorbed 0.5 Gt C y-1 during this period. Meanwhile, tropical deforestation is thought to have released an average 1.6 Gt C y-1 over the 1980s. While the fluxes among the four pools should balance, the average 198Ds values lead to a `missing sink' of 1.4 Gt C y-1 Several processes, including forest regrowth, CO2 fertilization of plant growth (c. 1.0 Gt C y-1), N deposition (c. 0.6 Gt C y-1), and their interactions, may account for the budget imbalance. However, it remains difficult to quantify the influences of these separate but interactive processes. Uncertainties in the individual numbers are large, and are themselves poorly quantified. This paper presents detail beyond the IPCC assessment on procedures used to approximate the flux uncertainties. Lack of knowledge about positive and negative feedbacks from the biosphere is a major limiting factor to credible simulations of future atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Analyses of the atmospheric gradients of CO2 and 13 CO2 concentrations provide increasingly strong evidence for terrestrial sinks, potentially distributed between Northern Hemisphere and tropical regions, but conclusive detection in direct biomass and soil measurements remains elusive. Current regional-to-global terrestrial ecosystem models with coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles represent the effects of CO2 fertilization differently, but all suggest longterm responses to CO2 that are substantially smaller than potential leaf- or laboratory whole plant-level responses. Analyses of emissions and biogeochemical fluxes consistent with eventual stabilization of atmospheric CO2 concentrations are sensitive to the way in which biospheric feedbacks are modeled by c. 15\%. Decisions about land use can have effects of 100s of Gt C over the next few centuries, with similarly significant effects on the atmosphere. Critical areas for future research are continued measurements and analyses of atmospheric data (CO2 and 13CO2) to serve as large-scale constraints, process studies of the scaling from the photosynthetic response to CO2 to whole-ecosystem carbon storage, and rigorous quantification of the effects of changing land use on carbon storage.},

Decidedly less attention has been paid to understanding control exerted by community dynamics and biotic interactions. Yet a rich literature of theoretical and empirical contributions highlights the importance of considering how variation in microbial population ecology, especially biotic interactions, is related to variation in key biogeochemical processes like soil carbon formation. We demonstrate how a population and community ecology perspective can be used to (1) understand the impact of microbial communities on biogeochemical cycles and (2) reframe current theory and models to include more detailed microbial ecology. Through a series of simulations we illustrate how density dependence and key biotic interactions, such as competition and predation, can determine the degree to which microbes regulate soil biogeochemical cycles. The ecological perspective and model simulations we present lay the foundation for developing empirical research and complementary models that explore the diversity of ecological mechanisms that operate in microbial communities to regulate biogeochemical processes.},

  abstract = {In primary succession following deglaciation at Glacier Bay, Alaska, we tested the hypothesis that the major effect of initial nitrogen\textemdash{}fixing colonizers is to facilitate establishment of late\textemdash{}successional dominants and that other possible causes of successional change (e.g., life history factors governing seed rain and competitive interactions among species) need not be invoked. Environment changed dramatically through the first 200 yr of succession. Soil organic matter increased 10\textemdash{}fold in the upper mineral soil with corresponding increases in soil moisture, total nitrogen (N), and capacity to support plant growth and declines in bulk density, pH, and total phosphorus (P). Plant growth in pioneer soils tended to be simultaneously limited by both N and P, as well as by unknown factors (perhaps lack of mycorrhizae), whereas only P limited growth in older soils. Light availability to seedlings declined through succession. Early\textemdash{}successional species (Epilobium latifolium, Dryas drummondii) had smaller seeds, younger age at first reproduction, shorter life\textemdash{}span, and shorter height at maturity than did mid\textemdash{}successional (alder, Alnus sinuata) and late\textemdash{}successional species (sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis). Seed rain of alder and spruce was negligible in the pioneer stage, increased prior to the stage in which a species was dominant, and was greatest in the stage in which a species dominated. Vegetation in each successional stage inhibited germination and initial establishment of sown alder and spruce seeds (except a tendency of the 'black\textemdash{}crust') algal/microbial community in the pioneer stage to enhance survivorship). Removal of the surface litter layer generally enhanced germination and survivorship, particularly of alder. Comparisons of germination in the greenhouse and the field indicated that climatic or indirect vegetation effects (e.g., differential seed predation) and allelopathy also reduced germination and establishment in vegetated communities. Naturally occurring spruce seedlings grew most rapidly in the Dryas and alder stages and most slowly in the spruce stage. Similarly, growth of spruce seedlings transplanted into each successional stage was facilitated by the Dryas (nonsignificantly) and alder stages but inhibited by the spruce stage, relative to earlier successional stages. Facilitation of growth of natural and transplanted spruce seedlings by Dryas and alder stages was associated with higher N and P uptake and tissue nutrient concentrations, whereas nutrient uptake and concentration in spruce seedlings declined in the spruce stage. By contrast, transplanted alder seedlings grew rapidly and accumulated most nutrients in the pioneer stage and were strongly inhibited by subsequent stages. The facilitative effect of Dryas and alder comes primarily from inputs of organic matter and associated N. Addition of alder litter stimulated nutrient uptake and growth of transplanted spruce seedlings in the pioneer and Dryas stages, whereas shading had no effect on growth of spruce seedlings. Root trenching and planting of spruce near isolated alders indicated that, although the net effect of alder is facilitative, alder also inhibits growth of spruce seedlings through competition for soil resources. Strong root competition also occurs in the spruce stage. Alder competitively inhibits Dryas, primarily by shading but also through the physical and allelopathic effects of its litter. In general, both at Glacier Bay and elsewhere, life history traits determine the pattern of succession. Changes in competitive balance accompanying successional changes in environment provide the mechanism for changes in species dominance. Initial site conditions (and facilitation, where present) influence the rate of change and final state of community composition and productivity. We conclude that no single factor or mechanism fully accounts for primary succession at Glacier Bay.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity enhances ecosystem functions such as biomass production and nutrient cycling. Although the majority of the terrestrial biodiversity is hidden in soils, very little is known about the importance of the diversity of microbial communities for soil functioning. Here, we tested effects of biodiversity on the functioning of methanotrophs, a specialized group of soil bacteria that plays a key role in mediating greenhouse gas emissions from soils. Using pure strains of methanotrophic bacteria, we assembled artificial communities of different diversity levels, with which we inoculated sterile soil microcosms. To assess the functioning of these communities, we measured methane oxidation by gas chromatography throughout the experiment and determined changes in community composition and community size at several time points by quantitative PCR and sequencing. We demonstrate that microbial diversity had a positive overyielding effect on methane oxidation, in particular at the beginning of the experiment. This higher assimilation of CH4 at high diversity translated into increased growth and significantly larger communities towards the end of the study. The overyielding of mixtures with respect to CH4 consumption and community size were positively correlated. The temporal CH4 consumption profiles of strain monocultures differed, raising the possibility that temporal complementarity of component strains drove the observed community-level strain richness effects; however, the community niche metric we derived from the temporal activity profiles did not explain the observed strain richness effect. The strain richness effect also was unrelated to both the phylogenetic and functional trait diversity of mixed communities. Overall, our results suggest that positive biodiversity\textendash{}ecosystem-function relationships show similar patterns across different scales and may be widespread in nature. Additionally, biodiversity is probably also important in natural methanotrophic communities for the ecosystem function methane oxidation. Therefore, maintaining soil conditions that support a high diversity of methanotrophs may help to reduce the emission of the greenhouse gas methane.},

  abstract = {The spatial variability exhibited by soil denitriflcation rates is high. As is typical for natural denitriflcation rate measurements, the individual rates of most samples of a given data set are low; however, a few samples often exhibit extremely high rates. Such data are characterized by highly skewed sample frequency distributions. This study was initiated to investigate the underlying mechanisms responsible for these observations. It was found that "hot-spots" of high specific denitriflcation activity were associated with particulate organic C material in the soil. The high specific activities of these hot-spots (incubated under aerobic conditions with no amendments) were similar to the denitrification activity of the bulk soil measured under conditions of anaerobiosis with added glucose and NO3. This observation served as the basis of a computer model that evaluates the influence of the density and dispersion pattern of these high activity sites on the measured rates of denitrification. Histograms generated from computer simulations are very similar to histograms obtained for real data, supporting the concept that the patchy dispersion of particulate organic material in soil is a major factor influencing the variability of natural denitrification rates.},

  issn = {1354-1013, 1365-2486},
  abstract = {This experiment was designed to study three determinant factors in decomposition patterns of soil organic matter (SOM): temperature, water and carbon (C) inputs. The study combined field measurements with soil lab incubations and ends with a modelling framework based on the results obtained. Soil respiration was periodically measured at an oak savanna woodland and a ponderosa pine plantation. Intact soils cores were collected at both ecosystems, including soils with most labile C burnt off, soils with some labile C gone and soils with fresh inputs of labile C. Two treatments, dry-field condition and field capacity, were applied to an incubation that lasted 111 days. Short-term temperature changes were applied to the soils periodically to quantify temperature responses. This was done to prevent confounding results associated with different pools of C that would result by exposing treatments chronically to different temperature regimes. This paper discusses the role of the above-defined environmental factors on the variability of soil C dynamics. At the seasonal scale, temperature and water were, respectively, the main limiting factors controlling soil CO2 efflux for the ponderosa pine and the oak savanna ecosystems. Spatial and seasonal variations in plant activity (root respiration and exudates production) exerted a strong influence over the seasonal and spatial variation of soil metabolic activity. Mean residence times of bulk SOM were significantly lower at the Nitrogen (N)-rich deciduous savanna than at the N-limited evergreen dominated pine ecosystem. At shorter time scales (daily), SOM decomposition was controlled primarily by temperature during wet periods and by the combined effect of water and temperature during dry periods. Secondary control was provided by the presence/absence of plant derived C inputs (exudation). Further analyses of SOM decomposition suggest that factors such as changes in the decomposer community, stress-induced changes in the metabolic activity of decomposers or SOM stabilization patterns remain unresolved, but should also be considered in future SOM decomposition studies. Observations and confounding factors associated with SOM decomposition patterns and its temperature sensitivity are summarized in the modeling framework.},

  volume = {275},
  issn = {0962-8452},
  abstract = {Global climate change has accelerated the pace of glacial retreat in high-latitude and high-elevation environments, exposing lands that remain devoid of vegetation for many years. The exposure of `new' soil is particularly apparent at high elevations (5000 metres above sea level) in the Peruvian Andes, where extreme environmental conditions hinder plant colonization. Nonetheless, these seemingly barren soils contain a diverse microbial community; yet the biogeochemical role of micro-organisms at these extreme elevations remains unknown. Using biogeochemical and molecular techniques, we investigated the biological community structure and ecosystem functioning of the pre-plant stages of primary succession in soils along a high-Andean chronosequence. We found that recently glaciated soils were colonized by a diverse community of cyanobacteria during the first 4\textendash{}5 years following glacial retreat. This significant increase in cyanobacterial diversity corresponded with equally dramatic increases in soil stability, heterotrophic microbial biomass, soil enzyme activity and the presence and abundance of photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments. Furthermore, we found that soil nitrogen-fixation rates increased almost two orders of magnitude during the first 4\textendash{}5 years of succession, many years before the establishment of mosses, lichens or vascular plants. Carbon analyses (pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy) of soil organic matter suggested that soil carbon along the chronosequence was of microbial origin. This indicates that inputs of nutrients and organic matter during early ecosystem development at these sites are dominated by microbial carbon and nitrogen fixation. Overall, our results indicate that photosynthetic and nitrogen-fixing bacteria play important roles in acquiring nutrients and facilitating ecological succession in soils near some of the highest elevation receding glaciers on the Earth.},

  abstract = {Primary succession is a fundamental process in macroecosystems; however, if and how soil development influences microbial community structure is poorly understood. Thus, we investigated changes in the bacterial community along a chronosequence of three unvegetated, early successional soils ({$\sim$}20-year age gradient) from a receding glacier in southeastern Peru using molecular phylogenetic techniques. We found that evenness, phylogenetic diversity, and the number of phylotypes were lowest in the youngest soils, increased in the intermediate aged soils, and plateaued in the oldest soils. This increase in diversity was commensurate with an increase in the number of sequences related to common soil bacteria in the older soils, including members of the divisions Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Verrucomicrobia. Sequences related to the Comamonadaceae clade of the Betaproteobacteria were dominant in the youngest soil, decreased in abundance in the intermediate age soil, and were not detected in the oldest soil. These sequences are closely related to culturable heterotrophs from rock and ice environments, suggesting that they originated from organisms living within or below the glacier. Sequences related to a variety of nitrogen (N)-fixing clades within the Cyanobacteria were abundant along the chronosequence, comprising 6\textendash{}40\% of phylotypes along the age gradient. Although there was no obvious change in the overall abundance of cyanobacterial sequences along the chronosequence, there was a dramatic shift in the abundance of specific cyanobacterial phylotypes, with the intermediate aged soils containing the greatest diversity of these sequences. Most soil biogeochemical characteristics showed little change along this {$\sim$}20-year soil age gradient; however, soil N pools significantly increased with soil age, perhaps as a result of the activity of the N-fixing Cyanobacteria. Our results suggest that, like macrobial communities, soil microbial communities are structured by substrate age, and that they, too, undergo predictable changes through time.},

Much of this was built on the long-term research of William S. Cooper, who established a permanent plot network in Glacier Bay, Alaska, in 1916. This study now represents the longest-running primary succession plot network in the world. Permanent plots are useful for their ability to follow mechanistic change through time without assumptions inherent in space-for-time (chronosequence) designs. After 100-yr, these plots show surprising variety in species composition, soil characteristics (carbon, nitrogen, depth), and percent cover, attributable to variation in initial vegetation establishment first noted by Cooper in the 1916\textendash{}1923 time period, partially driven by dispersal limitations. There has been almost a complete community composition replacement over the century and general species richness increase, but the effective number of species has declined significantly due to dominance of Salix species which established 100-yr prior (the only remaining species from the original cohort). Where Salix dominates, there is no establishment of ``later'' successional species like Picea. Plots nearer the entrance to Glacier Bay, and thus closer to potential seed sources after the most recent glaciation, have had consistently higher species richness for 100 yr. Age of plots is the best predictor of soil N content and C:N ratio, though plots still dominated by Salix had lower overall N; soil accumulation was more associated with dominant species. This highlights the importance of contingency and dispersal in community development. The 100-yr record of these plots, including species composition, spatial relationships, cover, and observed interactions between species provides a powerful view of long-term primary succession.},

Random forests have been shown to achieve a high prediction accuracy in such applications and to provide descriptive variable importance measures reflecting the impact of each variable in both main effects and interactions.

  shorttitle = {Bias in Random Forest Variable Importance Measures},
  abstract = {Background
Variable importance measures for random forests have been receiving increased attention as a means of variable selection in many classification tasks in bioinformatics and related scientific fields, for instance to select a subset of genetic markers relevant for the prediction of a certain disease. We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories.

Results
Simulation studies are presented illustrating that, when random forest variable importance measures are used with data of varying types, the results are misleading because suboptimal predictor variables may be artificially preferred in variable selection. The two mechanisms underlying this deficiency are biased variable selection in the individual classification trees used to build the random forest on one hand, and effects induced by bootstrap sampling with replacement on the other hand.

Conclusion
We propose to employ an alternative implementation of random forests, that provides unbiased variable selection in the individual classification trees. When this method is applied using subsampling without replacement, the resulting variable importance measures can be used reliably for variable selection even in situations where the potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. The usage of both random forest algorithms and their variable importance measures in the R system for statistical computing is illustrated and documented thoroughly in an application re-analyzing data from a study on RNA editing. Therefore the suggested method can be applied straightforwardly by scientists in bioinformatics research.},

Two fundamental problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to fit such models have been known for a long time: overfitting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overfitting problem, the variable selection bias still seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured regression models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a common theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance of established exhaustive search procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore the models induced by both approaches are structurally different, confirming the need for an unbiased variable selection. Moreover, it is shown that the prediction accuracy of trees with early stopping is equivalent to the prediction accuracy of pruned trees with unbiased variable selection. The methodology presented here is applicable to all kinds of regression problems, including nominal, ordinal, numeric, censored as well as multivariate response variables and arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates.

The idea of functional redundancy for microbial communities has long been assumed, so that the high level of richness is often explained by the presence of different taxa that are able to conduct the exact same set of metabolic processes and that can readily replace each other. Here, we refute the hypothesis of functional redundancy for marine microbial communities by showing that a shift in the community composition altered the overall functional attributes of communities across different temporal and spatial scales. Our metagenomic monitoring of a coastal northwestern Mediterranean site also revealed that diverse microbial communities harbor a high diversity of potential proteins. Working with all information given by the metagenomes (all reads) rather than relying only on known genes (annotated orthologous genes) was essential for revealing the similarity between taxonomic and functional community compositions. Our finding does not exclude the possibility for a partial redundancy where organisms that share some specific function can coexist when they differ in other ecological requirements. It demonstrates, however, that marine microbial diversity reflects a tremendous diversity of microbial metabolism and highlights the genetic potential yet to be discovered in an ocean of microbes.},

  volume = {237},
  issn = {0167-8809},
  abstract = {The ability of cover crop mixtures to provide both nitrogen (N) retention and N supply services has been extensively studied in research station experiments, especially with grass-legume bicultures. Mixtures are often as effective as grass monocultures at N retention, but the N supply service can be compromised when non-legumes dilute the presence of legumes in a cover crop stand. To study the tradeoffs between N retention and supply when using cover crop mixtures, we measured N retention and supply in distributed on-farm experiments, developed multiple linear regression models to predict N retention and supply based on cover crop functional characteristics and environmental variables, and synthesized the regression models into a graphical analysis tool. The experiments took place on three organic farms and a research station in Pennsylvania, USA and tested 3-species and 4-species cover crop mixtures in comparison to commonly used grass and legume monocultures. Cover crop treatments were planted between a small grain crop harvested in mid-summer and a maize (Zea mays L.) crop planted the following spring. Potential nitrate (NO3-) leaching below 30cm, an indicator of the N retention service, declined as the presence of non-legume species in a cover crop increased (r2=0.72). Potential NO3- leaching increased as the August soil NO3--N concentration increased and as the fall biomass N content of winter-killed species or canola (Brassica napus L. `Wichita') increased. Relative maize yield, an indicator of the N supply service, decreased as fall and spring cover crop biomass carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratios increased and increased as total spring biomass N content and soil carbon (C) concentration increased (r2=0.56). Synthesizing the regression models in a graphical analysis tool revealed a tradeoff between N supply and retention services for cover crop mixtures, where increasing the fractional non-legume seeding rate to reduce potential NO3- leaching also reduced relative maize yield. The tradeoff could be minimized by managing environmental conditions and cover crop composition so that potential NO3- leaching remains low even when the fractional non-legume seeding rate is low. The regression models suggest this could be achieved by maintaining low soil NO3--N concentrations prior to cover crop planting in August, not including winter-killed legumes in the mixture, and using non-legume species that are the most efficient at N retention. Thus, with thoughtful management of cover crops and soils, farmers may be able to realize the potential of cover crop mixtures to provide high levels of both N retention and supply services.},

  abstract = {Current practice in the normalization of microbiome count data is inefficient in the statistical sense. For apparently historical reasons, the common approach is either to use simple proportions (which does not address heteroscedasticity) or to use rarefying of counts, even though both of these approaches are inappropriate for detection of differentially abundant species. Well-established statistical theory is available that simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological variability using an appropriate mixture model. Moreover, specific implementations for DNA sequencing read count data (based on a Negative Binomial model for instance) are already available in RNA-Seq focused R packages such as edgeR and DESeq. Here we summarize the supporting statistical theory and use simulations and empirical data to demonstrate substantial improvements provided by a relevant mixture model framework over simple proportions or rarefying. We show how both proportions and rarefied counts result in a high rate of false positives in tests for species that are differentially abundant across sample classes. Regarding microbiome sample-wise clustering, we also show that the rarefying procedure often discards samples that can be accurately clustered by alternative methods. We further compare different Negative Binomial methods with a recently-described zero-inflated Gaussian mixture, implemented in a package called metagenomeSeq. We find that metagenomeSeq performs well when there is an adequate number of biological replicates, but it nevertheless tends toward a higher false positive rate. Based on these results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific extensions to these tools in the R package, phyloseq.},

  abstract = {Although it is generally accepted that plant community composition is key for predicting rates of ecosystem processes in the face of global change, microbial community composition is often ignored in ecosystem modeling. To address this issue, we review recent experiments and assess whether microbial community composition is resistant, resilient, or functionally redundant in response to four different disturbances. We find that the composition of most microbial groups is sensitive and not immediately resilient to disturbance, regardless of taxonomic breadth of the group or the type of disturbance. Other studies demonstrate that changes in composition are often associated with changes in ecosystem process rates. Thus, changes in microbial communities due to disturbance may directly affect ecosystem processes. Based on these relationships, we propose a simple framework to incorporate microbial community composition into ecosystem process models. We conclude that this effort would benefit from more empirical data on the links among microbial phylogeny, physiological traits, and disturbance responses. These relationships will determine how readily microbial community composition can be used to predict the responses of ecosystem processes to global change.},

  abstract = {Plant-associated microorganisms have been shown to critically affect host physiology and performance, suggesting that evolution and ecology of plants and animals can only be understood in a holobiont (host and its associated organisms) context. Host-associated microbial community structures are affected by abiotic and host factors, and increased attention is given to the role of the microbiome in interactions such as pathogen inhibition. However, little is known about how these factors act on the microbial community, and especially what role microbe\textendash{}microbe interaction dynamics play. We have begun to address this knowledge gap for phyllosphere microbiomes of plants by simultaneously studying three major groups of Arabidopsis thaliana symbionts (bacteria, fungi and oomycetes) using a systems biology approach. We evaluated multiple potential factors of microbial community control: we sampled various wild A. thaliana populations at different times, performed field plantings with different host genotypes, and implemented successive host colonization experiments under lab conditions where abiotic factors, host genotype, and pathogen colonization was manipulated. Our results indicate that both abiotic factors and host genotype interact to affect plant colonization by all three groups of microbes. Considering microbe\textendash{}microbe interactions, however, uncovered a network of interkingdom interactions with significant contributions to community structure. As in other scale-free networks, a small number of taxa, which we call microbial ``hubs,'' are strongly interconnected and have a severe effect on communities. By documenting these microbe\textendash{}microbe interactions, we uncover an important mechanism explaining how abiotic factors and host genotypic signatures control microbial communities. In short, they act directly on ``hub'' microbes, which, via microbe\textendash{}microbe interactions, transmit the effects to the microbial community. We analyzed two ``hub'' microbes (the obligate biotrophic oomycete pathogen Albugo and the basidiomycete yeast fungus Dioszegia) more closely. Albugo had strong effects on epiphytic and endophytic bacterial colonization. Specifically, alpha diversity decreased and beta diversity stabilized in the presence of Albugo infection, whereas they otherwise varied between plants. Dioszegia, on the other hand, provided evidence for direct hub interaction with phyllosphere bacteria. The identification of microbial ``hubs'' and their importance in phyllosphere microbiome structuring has crucial implications for plant\textendash{}pathogen and microbe\textendash{}microbe research and opens new entry points for ecosystem management and future targeted biocontrol. The revelation that effects can cascade through communities via ``hub'' microbes is important to understand community structure perturbations in parallel fields including human microbiomes and bioprocesses. In particular, parallels to human microbiome ``keystone'' pathogens and microbes open new avenues of interdisciplinary research that promise to better our understanding of functions of host-associated microbiomes.},

We applied our approaches to expression data from blood and adipose tissue measured in {$\sim$}3,000 individuals overall. We imputed gene expression into GWAS data from over 900,000 phenotype measurements to identify 69 new genes significantly associated with obesity-related traits (BMI, lipids and height). Many of these genes are associated with relevant phenotypes in the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel.

The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

  abstract = {Microbiomes impact nearly all systems on Earth, and despite vast differences among systems, we contend that it is possible and highly beneficial to develop a unified conceptual framework for understanding microbiome dynamics that is applicable across systems. The ability to robustly predict and control environmental and human microbiomes would provide impactful opportunities to sustain and improve the health of ecosystems and humans alike. Doing so requires understanding the processes governing microbiome temporal dynamics, which currently presents an enormous challenge. We contend, however, that new opportunities can emerge by placing studies of both environmental and human microbiome temporal dynamics in the context of a unified conceptual framework. Our conceptual framework poses that factors influencing the temporal dynamics of microbiomes can be grouped into three broad categories: biotic and abiotic history, internal dynamics, and external forcing factors. Both environmental and human microbiome science study these factors, but not in a coordinated or consistent way. Here we discuss opportunities for greater crosstalk across these domains, such as leveraging specific ecological concepts from environmental microbiome science to guide optimization of strategies to manipulate human microbiomes towards improved health. To achieve unified understanding, it is necessary to have a common body of theory developed from explicit iteration between models and molecular-based characterization of microbiome dynamics across systems. Only through such model-experiment iteration will we eventually achieve prediction and control across microbiomes that impact ecosystem sustainability and human health.},

Because EH varies at multiple spatial scales, so too are microbial variables expected to vary. The determination of SD \texttimes{} EH interactions at multiple scales is, however, not a trivial exercise, especially when one examines their effects on microbial abundance and genomic similarities. Here we assessed those interactions at all scales perceptible in a patchy environment composed of known plant species and of heterogeneous soil physical and chemical parameters. For free-living, soil-borne Burkholderia ambifaria, genomic similarities responded to most of the spatial scales that the experimental sampling scheme could reveal, despite limited dispersal of the individuals. Species abundance and community composition were, however, responding to much smaller scales more consistent with local responses to EH. Our results suggest that whole-genome similarities may reflect the simultaneous effects of both SD and EH in microbial populations, but the pure effects of each factor only contributed to {$<$}2\% of the total genetic variation. The large amount of unexplained variation that remains after considering most environmental, spatial, and biological interactions is then posited to be the result of noise introduced by unmeasured environmental and spatial variability, sampling effects, and neutral ecological drift.},

  abstract = {The historical conditions under which bacterial lineages evolve determine their functional traits, and consequently their contribution to ecosystem functions (EFs). Under significant trait conservatism, which is common in prokaryotes, phylogeny may track the evolutionary history of species and predict their functionality. Productive communities can arise from: (i) the coexistence of functional, and therefore phylogenetically distant lineages, producing high EF rates at large phylogenetic diversity (PD); (ii) the dominance of productive lineages that outcompete other clades, generating high EF at low PD. Community composition will modulate the PD\textendash{}EF relationship: The effects of anciently divergent lineages, whose deeply conserved functions determine the occupancy of major niches, may differ from that of recently divergent lineages showing adaptations to current conditions. We hypothesized that, in our model Mediterranean ecosystem, EF can be explained both by competitive superiority of ancient lineages and functional complementarity of recent lineages. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced a phylogenetic marker targeting bacteria across 28 soil plots and quantified EF related to microbial productivity, decomposition and nutrient cycling. Plots accumulating recently divergent lineages consistently showed higher EF levels that were slightly modified by the accumulation of ancient lineages. We discuss the assembly processes behind these phylogenetic-scale disparities and the final outcome in terms of ecosystem functioning.},

Alterations in gut microbiota composition correlate with intestinal and extraintestinal disease and, although only a few mechanisms are known, the microbiota are still an attractive target for developing biomarkers for disease detection and management as well as potential therapeutic applications. In this Review, we summarize the major decision points confronting new entrants to the field or for those designing new projects in microbiome research.

Here, we provide a roadmap of the most widely used and ecologically relevant approaches for analysis through a series of mission statements. We distinguish two types of {$\beta$} diversity: directional turnover along a gradient vs. non-directional variation. Different measures emphasize different properties of ecological data. Such properties include the degree of emphasis on presence/absence vs. relative abundance information and the inclusion vs. exclusion of joint absences. Judicious use of multiple measures in concert can uncover the underlying nature of patterns in {$\beta$} diversity for a given dataset. A case study of Indonesian coral assemblages shows the utility of a multi-faceted approach. We advocate careful consideration of relevant questions, matched by appropriate analyses. The rigorous application of null models will also help to reveal potential processes driving observed patterns in {$\beta$} diversity.},

  abstract = {Although microbial communities are ubiquitous in nature, relatively little is known about the structural and functional roles of their constituent organisms' underlying interactions. A common approach to study such questions begins with extracting a network of statistically significant pairwise co-occurrences from a matrix of observed operational taxonomic unit (OTU) abundances across sites. The structure of this network is assumed to encode information about ecological interactions and processes, resistance to perturbation, and the identity of keystone species. However, common methods for identifying these pairwise interactions can contaminate the network with spurious patterns that obscure true ecological signals. Here, we describe this problem in detail and develop a solution that incorporates null models to distinguish ecological signals from statistical noise. We apply these methods to the initial OTU abundance matrix and to the extracted network. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to a large soil microbiome data set and show that many previously reported patterns for these data are statistical artifacts. In contrast, we find the frequency of three-way interactions among microbial OTUs to be highly statistically significant. These results demonstrate the importance of using appropriate null models when studying observational microbiome data, and suggest that extracting and characterizing three-way interactions among OTUs is a promising direction for unraveling the structure and function of microbial ecosystems.},

Most of this work has focused on succession in plant communities, laying the conceptual foundation for much of what we currently know about community assembly patterns over time. Because of their prevalence and importance in ecosystems, an increasing number of studies have focused on microbial community dynamics during succession. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of bacterial primary succession patterns across a range of distinct habitats, including the infant gut, plant surfaces, soil chronosequences, and aquatic environments, to determine whether consistent changes in bacterial diversity, community composition, and functional traits are evident over the course of succession. Although these distinct habitats harbor unique bacterial communities, we were able to identify patterns in community assembly that were shared across habitat types. We found an increase in taxonomic and functional diversity with time while the taxonomic composition and functional profiles of communities became less variable (lower beta diversity) in late successional stages. In addition, we found consistent decreases in the rRNA operon copy number and in the high-efficient phosphate assimilation process (Pst system) suggesting that reductions in resource availability during succession select for taxa adapted to low-resource conditions. Together, these results highlight that, like many plant communities, microbial communities also exhibit predictable patterns during primary succession.},

  abstract = {Analysis of intragenomic variation of 16S rRNA genes is a unique approach to examining the concept of ribosomal constraints on rRNA genes; the degree of variation is an important parameter to consider for estimation of the diversity of a complex microbiome in the recently initiated Human Microbiome Project (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/hmp). The current GenBank database has a collection of 883 prokaryotic genomes representing 568 unique species, of which 425 species contained 2 to 15 copies of 16S rRNA genes per genome (2.22 {$\pm$} 0.81). Sequence diversity among the 16S rRNA genes in a genome was found in 235 species (from 0.06\% to 20.38\%; 0.55\% {$\pm$} 1.46\%). Compared with the 16S rRNA-based threshold for operational definition of species (1 to 1.3\% diversity), the diversity was borderline (between 1\% and 1.3\%) in 10 species and {$>$}1.3\% in 14 species. The diversified 16S rRNA genes in Haloarcula marismortui (diversity, 5.63\%) and Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis (6.70\%) were highly conserved at the 2\textdegree{} structure level, while the diversified gene in B. afzelii (20.38\%) appears to be a pseudogene. The diversified genes in the remaining 21 species were also conserved, except for a truncated 16S rRNA gene in ``Candidatus Protochlamydia amoebophila.'' Thus, this survey of intragenomic diversity of 16S rRNA genes provides strong evidence supporting the theory of ribosomal constraint. Taxonomic classification using the 16S rRNA-based operational threshold could misclassify a number of species into more than one species, leading to an overestimation of the diversity of a complex microbiome. This phenomenon is especially seen in 7 bacterial species associated with the human microbiome or diseases.},

  abstract = {Ever since Carl Woese introduced the use of 16S rRNA genes for determining the phylogenetic relationships of prokaryotes, this method has been regarded as the ``gold standard'' in both microbial phylogeny and ecology studies. However, intragenomic heterogeneity within 16S rRNA genes has been reported in many investigations and is believed to bias the estimation of prokaryotic diversity. In the current study, 2,013 completely sequenced genomes of bacteria and archaea were analyzed and intragenomic heterogeneity was found in 952 genomes (585 species), with 87.5\% of the divergence detected being below the 1\% level. In particular, some extremophiles (thermophiles and halophiles) were found to harbor highly divergent 16S rRNA genes. Overestimation caused by 16S rRNA gene intragenomic heterogeneity was evaluated at different levels using the full-length and partial 16S rRNA genes usually chosen as targets for pyrosequencing. The result indicates that, at the unique level, full-length 16S rRNA genes can produce an overestimation of as much as 123.7\%, while at the 3\% level, an overestimation of 12.9\% for the V6 region may be introduced. Further analysis showed that intragenomic heterogeneity tends to concentrate in specific positions, with the V1 and V6 regions suffering the most intragenomic heterogeneity and the V4 and V5 regions suffering the least intragenomic heterogeneity in bacteria. This is the most up-to-date overview of the diversity of 16S rRNA genes within prokaryotic genomes. It not only provides general guidance on how much overestimation can be introduced when applying 16S rRNA gene-based methods, due to its intragenomic heterogeneity, but also recommends that, for bacteria, this overestimation be minimized using primers targeting the V4 and V5 regions.},

  abstract = {Accurately estimating methane (CH4) flux in terrestrial ecosystems is critically important for investigating and predicting biogeochemistry-climate feedbacks. Improved simulations of CH4 flux require explicit representations of the microbial processes that account for CH4 dynamics. A microbial functional group-based module was developed, building on the decomposition subroutine of the Community Land Model 4.5. This module considers four key mechanisms for CH4 production and consumption: methanogenesis from acetate or from single-carbon compounds and CH4 oxidation using molecular oxygen or other inorganic electron acceptors. Four microbial functional groups perform these processes: acetoclastic methanogens, hydrogenotrophic methanogens, aerobic methanotrophs, and anaerobic methanotrophs. This module was used to simulate dynamics of carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 concentrations from an incubation experiment with permafrost soils. The results show that the model captures the dynamics of CO2 and CH4 concentrations in microcosms with top soils, mineral layer soils, and permafrost soils under natural and saturated moisture conditions and three temperature conditions of -2\textdegree{}C, 3\textdegree{}C, and 5\textdegree{}C (R2 {$>$} 0.67; P {$<$} 0.001). The biases for modeled results are less than 30\% across the soil samples and moisture and temperature conditions. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the importance of acetic acid's direct contribution as substrate and indirect effects through pH feedback on CO2 and CH4 production and consumption. This study suggests that representing the microbial mechanisms is critical for modeling CH4 production and consumption; it is urgent to incorporate microbial mechanisms into Earth system models for better predicting trace gas dynamics and the behavior of the climate system.},

Interactions between environmental microbiologists and human microbiota researchers have already contributed to advances in our understanding of the human microbiome. We review the work that has led to these recent advances and illustrate some of the possible future directions for continued collaboration between these groups of researchers. We discuss how the application of ecological theory to the human-associated microbiota can lead us past descriptions of community structure and toward an understanding of the functions of the human microbiota.

The microbiome is assembled at birth, develops with its host, and is greatly influenced by environmental factors such as diet and other exposures. Recently, a role for human genetic variation has emerged as also influential in accounting for interpersonal differences in microbiomes. Thus, human genes may influence health directly or by promoting a beneficial microbiome. Studies of the heritability of gut microbiotas reveal a subset of microbes whose abundances are partly genetically determined by the host. However, the use of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to identify human genetic variants associated with microbiome phenotypes has proven challenging. Studies to date are small by GWAS standards, and cross-study comparisons are hampered by differences in analytical approaches. Nevertheless, associations between microbes or microbial genes and human genes have emerged that are consistent between human populations. Most notably, higher levels of beneficial gut bacteria called Bifidobacteria are associated with the human lactase nonpersister genotype, which typically confers lactose intolerance, in several different human populations. It is time for the microbiome to be incorporated into studies that quantify interactions among genotype, environment, and the microbiome in order to predict human disease susceptibility.},

Here, we address a fundamental and unanswered question in microbial ecology: `When do we need to understand microbial community structure to accurately predict function?' We present a statistical analysis investigating the value of environmental data and microbial community structure independently and in combination for explaining rates of carbon and nitrogen cycling processes within 82 global datasets. Environmental variables were the strongest predictors of process rates but left 44\% of variation unexplained on average, suggesting the potential for microbial data to increase model accuracy. Although only 29\% of our datasets were significantly improved by adding information on microbial community structure, we observed improvement in models of processes mediated by narrow phylogenetic guilds via functional gene data, and conversely, improvement in models of facultative microbial processes via community diversity metrics. Our results also suggest that microbial diversity can strengthen predictions of respiration rates beyond microbial biomass parameters, as 53\% of models were improved by incorporating both sets of predictors compared to 35\% by microbial biomass alone. Our analysis represents the first comprehensive analysis of research examining links between microbial community structure and ecosystem function. Taken together, our results indicate that a greater understanding of microbial communities informed by ecological principles may enhance our ability to predict ecosystem process rates relative to assessments based on environmental variables and microbial physiology.},

  abstract = {How ecosystem functioning changes with microbial communities remains an open question in natural ecosystems. Both present-day environmental conditions and historical events, such as past differences in dispersal, can have a greater influence over ecosystem function than the diversity or abundance of both taxa and genes. Here, we estimated how individual and interactive effects of microbial community structure defined by diversity and abundance, present-day environmental conditions, and an indicator of historical legacies influenced ecosystem functioning in lake sediments. We studied sediments because they have strong gradients in all three of these ecosystem properties and deliver important functions worldwide. By characterizing bacterial community composition and functional traits at eight sites fed by discrete and contrasting catchments, we found that taxonomic diversity and the normalized abundance of oxidase-encoding genes explained as much variation in CO2 production as present-day gradients of pH and organic matter quantity and quality. Functional gene diversity was not linked to CO2 production rates. Surprisingly, the effects of taxonomic diversity and normalized oxidase abundance in the model predicting CO2 production were~attributable to site-level differences in bacterial communities unrelated to the present-day environment, suggesting that colonization history rather than habitat-based filtering indirectly influenced ecosystem functioning. Our findings add to limited evidence that biodiversity and gene abundance explain patterns of microbiome functioning in nature. Yet we highlight among the first time how these relationships depend directly on present-day environmental conditions and indirectly on historical legacies, and so need to be contextualized with these other ecosystem properties.},

While rRNA analyses are no longer commonly used to quantify a population's growth rate in mixed communities, due to rRNA concentration not scaling linearly with growth rate uniformly across taxa, rRNA analyses are still frequently used toward the more conservative goal of identifying populations that are currently active in a mixed community. Yet, evidence indicates that the general use of rRNA as a reliable indicator of metabolic state in microbial assemblages has serious limitations. This report highlights the complex and often contradictory relationships between rRNA, growth and activity. Potential mechanisms for confounding rRNA patterns are discussed, including differences in life histories, life strategies and non-growth activities. Ways in which rRNA data can be used for useful characterization of microbial assemblages are presented, along with questions to be addressed in future studies.},

However, quantitatively partitioning systems using two stable isotopes (for example, 13C and 12C) has been largely limited to only two sources, and systems of interest often have more than two components, with interactive effects. Here we introduce a dual-isotope approach to allow conclusive partitioning between three sources, using only two stable isotopes. We demonstrate this approach by partitioning soil CO2 emissions derived from microbial mineralization of soil organic carbon (SOC), added pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) and root respiration. We find that SOC mineralization in the presence of roots is 23\% higher (P{$<$}0.05) when PyOM is also present. Being able to discern three sources with two isotopes will be of great value not only in biogeochemical research, but may also expand hitherto untapped methodologies in diverse fields.},

  abstract = {Until recently, the common view of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle had been driven by two core assumptions\textemdash{}plants use only inorganic N and they compete poorly against soil microbes for N. Thus, plants were thought to use N that microbes ``left over,'' allowing the N cycle to be divided cleanly into two pieces\textemdash{}the microbial decomposition side and the plant uptake and use side. These were linked by the process of net mineralization. Over the last decade, research has changed these views. N cycling is now seen as being driven by the depolymerization of N-containing polymers by microbial (including mycorrhizal) extracellular enzymes. This releases organic N-containing monomers that may be used by either plants or microbes. However, a complete new conceptual model of the soil N cycle needs to incorporate recent research on plant\textendash{}microbe competition and microsite processes to explain the dynamics of N across the wide range of N availability found in terrestrial ecosystems. We discuss the evolution of thinking about the soil N cycle, propose a new integrated conceptual model that explains how N cycling changes as ecosystem N availability changes, and discuss methodological issues raised by the changing paradigm of terrestrial N cycling.},

Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal, to drive community dynamics.},

Physiological responses to stress have costs at the organismal level that can result in altered ecosystem-level C, energy, and nutrient flows. These large-scale impacts result from direct effects on active microbes' physiology and by controlling the composition of the active microbial community. We first consider some general aspects of how microbes experience environmental stresses and how they respond to them. We then discuss the impacts of two important ecosystem-level stressors, drought and freezing, on microbial physiology and community composition. Even when microbial community response to stress is limited, the physiological costs imposed on soil microbes are large enough that they may cause large shifts in the allocation and fate of C and N. For example, for microbes to synthesize the osmolytes they need to survive a single drought episode they may consume up to 5\% of total annual net primary production in grassland ecosystems, while acclimating to freezing conditions switches Arctic tundra soils from immobilizing N during the growing season to mineralizing it during the winter. We suggest that more effectively integrating microbial ecology into ecosystem ecology will require a more complete integration of microbial physiological ecology, population biology, and process ecology.},

Microbial community biomass, respiration, and fungal abundance significantly increased with greater plant diversity, as did N mineralization rates. However, changes in microbial community biomass, activity, and composition largely resulted from the higher levels of plant production associated with greater diversity, rather than from plant diversity per se. Nonetheless, greater plant production could not explain more rapid N mineralization, indicating that plant diversity affected this microbial process, which controls rates of ecosystem N cycling. Greater N availability probably contributed to the positive relationship between plant diversity and productivity in the N-limited soils of our experiment, suggesting that plant\textendash{}microbe interactions in soil are an integral component of plant diversity's influence on ecosystem function.},

Its quantification, however, is a subject of continuous debate, which seems to be caused by (1) its definition, which includes nongrowth components other than maintenance; (2) the existence of partly overlapping concepts; (3) the evolution of variables as constants; and (4) the neglect of cell death in microbial dynamics. The two historically most important parameters describing maintenance, the specific maintenance rate and the maintenance coefficient, are based on partly different nongrowth components. There is thus no constant relation between these parameters and previous equations on this subject are wrong. In addition, the partial overlap between these parameters does not allow the use of a simple combination of these parameters. This also applies for combinations of a threshold concentration with one of the other estimates of maintenance. Maintenance estimates should ideally explicitly describe each nongrowth component. A conceptual model is introduced that describes their relative importance and reconciles the various concepts and definitions. The sensitivity of maintenance on underlying components was analyzed and indicated that overall maintenance depends nonlinearly on relative death rates, relative growth rates, growth yield, and endogenous metabolism. This quantitative sensitivity analysis explains the felt need to develop growth-dependent adaptations of existing maintenance parameters, and indicates the importance of distinguishing the various nongrowth components. Future experiments should verify the sensitivity of maintenance components under cellular and environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {While there is no doubt that biogenic methane production in the Arctic is an important aspect of global methane emissions, the relative roles of microbial community characteristics and soil environmental conditions in controlling Arctic methane emissions remains uncertain. Here, relevant methane-cycling microbial groups were investigated at two remote Arctic sites with respect to soil potential methane production (PMP). Percent abundances of methanogens and iron-reducing bacteria correlated with increased PMP, while methanotrophs correlated with decreased PMP. Interestingly, {$\alpha$}-diversity of the methanogens was positively correlated with PMP, while {$\beta$}-diversity was unrelated to PMP. The {$\beta$}-diversity of the entire microbial community, however, was related to PMP. Shannon diversity was a better correlate of PMP than Simpson diversity across analyses, while rarefied species richness was a weak correlate of PMP. These results demonstrate the following: first, soil pH and microbial community structure both probably control methane production in Arctic soils. Second, there may be high functional redundancy in the methanogens with regard to methane production. Third, iron-reducing bacteria co-occur with methanogens in Arctic soils, and iron-reduction-mediated effects on methanogenesis may be controlled by {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-diversity. And finally, species evenness and rare species abundances may be driving relationships between microbial groups, influencing Arctic methane production.},

Here, we have traced methylotrophic members of a rice field soil microbial community, which became active upon continuous addition of 13C-methanol ({$<$}22 mM) as studied in microcosms. By combining rRNA- and DNA-based SIP, as well as domain-specific real-time PCR detection of templates in fractions of centrifugation gradients, we were able to detect 13C-labelled bacterial rRNA after 6 days of incubation. Fingerprinting and comparative sequence analysis of `heavy' bacterial rRNA showed that mostly members of the Methylobacteriaceae and a novel clade within the Methylophilaceae formed part of the indigenous methylotrophic community. Over time, however, the Methylophilaceae were enriched. Unexpectedly, nucleic acids of eukaryotic origin were detected, mostly in intermediately 13C-labelled gradient fractions. These eukaryotes were identified as fungi mostly related to Fusarium and Aspergillus spp., and also Cercozoa, known as predatory soil flagellates. The detection of fungi and protozoa in 13C-enriched nucleic acid fractions suggests a possible involvement in either direct assimilation of label by the fungi, or a food web, i.e. that primary 13C-methanol consuming methylotrophs were decomposed by fungi and grazed by protozoa.},

There are several different methods for analyzing DNA-SIP data and despite the power of SIP experiments, it remains difficult to comprehensively evaluate method accuracy across a wide range of experimental parameters. We have developed a toolset (SIPSim) that simulates DNA-SIP data, and we use this toolset to systematically evaluate different methods for analyzing DNA-SIP data. Specifically, we employ SIPSim to evaluate the effects that key experimental parameters (e.g. level of isotopic enrichment, number of labeled taxa, relative abundance of labeled taxa, community richness, community evenness, and beta-diversity) have on the specificity, sensitivity, and balanced accuracy (defined as the product of specificity and sensitivity) of DNA-SIP analyses. Furthermore, SIPSim can predict analytical accuracy and power as a function of experimental design and community characteristics, and thus should be of great use in the design and interpretation of DNA-SIP experiments.},

The types of microorganisms that assimilated 13C in the 13C-xylose treatment changed over time being predominantly Firmicutes at day 1 followed by Bacteroidetes at day 3 and then Actinobacteria at day 7. These 13C-labeling dynamics suggest labile C traveled through different trophic levels. In contrast, microorganisms generally metabolized cellulose-C after 14 days and did not change to the same extent in phylogenetic composition over time. Microorganisms that metabolized cellulose-C belonged to poorly characterized but cosmopolitan soil lineages including Verrucomicrobia, Chloroflexi and Planctomycetes.},

  abstract = {Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are key components of ecosystem productivity in arid lands and they cover a substantial fraction of the terrestrial surface. In particular, BSC N2-fixation contributes significantly to the nitrogen (N) budget of arid land ecosystems. In mature crusts, N2-fixation is largely attributed to heterocystous cyanobacteria; however, early successional crusts possess few N2-fixing cyanobacteria and this suggests that microorganisms other than cyanobacteria mediate N2-fixation during the critical early stages of BSC development. DNA stable isotope probing with 15N2 revealed that Clostridiaceae and Proteobacteria are the most common microorganisms that assimilate 15N2 in early successional crusts. The Clostridiaceae identified are divergent from previously characterized isolates, though N2-fixation has previously been observed in this family. The Proteobacteria identified share {$>$}98.5\% small subunit rRNA gene sequence identity with isolates from genera known to possess diazotrophs (for example, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Shigella and Ideonella). The low abundance of these heterotrophic diazotrophs in BSCs may explain why they have not been characterized previously. Diazotrophs have a critical role in BSC formation and characterization of these organisms represents a crucial step towards understanding how anthropogenic change will affect the formation and ecological function of BSCs in arid ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Methane emission from peatlands contributes substantially to global warming but is significantly reduced by sulfate reduction, which is fuelled by globally increasing aerial sulfur pollution. However, the biology behind sulfate reduction in terrestrial ecosystems is not well understood and the key players for this process as well as their abundance remained unidentified. Comparative 16S rRNA gene stable isotope probing (SIP) in the presence and absence of sulfate indicated that a Desulfosporosinus species, which constitutes only 0.006\% of the total microbial community 16S rRNA genes, is an important sulfate reducer in a long-term experimental peatland field site. Parallel SIP using dsrAB (encoding subunit A and B of the dissimilatory (bi)sulfite reductase) identified no additional sulfate reducers under the conditions tested. For the identified Desulfosporosinus species a high cell-specific sulfate reduction rate of up to 341 fmol SO42- cell-1 day-1 was estimated. Thus, the small Desulfosporosinus population has the potential to reduce sulfate in situ at a rate of 4.0\textendash{}36.8 nmol (g soil w. wt.)-1 day-1, sufficient to account for a considerable part of sulfate reduction in the peat soil. Modeling of sulfate diffusion to such highly active cells identified no limitation in sulfate supply even at bulk concentrations as low as 10 {$\mu$}M. Collectively, these data show that the identified Desulfosporosinus species, despite being a member of the `rare biosphere', contributes to an important biogeochemical process that diverts the carbon flow in peatlands from methane to CO2 and, thus, alters their contribution to global warming.},

Here, we develop and apply a method, Halogen In Situ Hybridization-Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (HISH-SIMS), and show that it allows simultaneous phylogenetic identification and quantitation of metabolic activities of single microbial cells in the environment. Using HISH-SIMS, individual cells of the anaerobic, phototropic bacteria Chromatium okenii, Lamprocystis purpurea, and Chlorobium clathratiforme inhabiting the oligotrophic, meromictic Lake Cadagno were analyzed with respect to H13CO3- and 15NH4+ assimilation. Metabolic rates were found to vary greatly between individual cells of the same species, showing that microbial populations in the environment are heterogeneous, being comprised of physiologically distinct individuals. Furthermore, C. okenii, the least abundant species representing {$\approx$}0.3\% of the total cell number, contributed more than 40\% of the total uptake of ammonium and 70\% of the total uptake of carbon in the system, thereby emphasizing that numerically inconspicuous microbes can play a significant role in the nitrogen and carbon cycles in the environment. By introducing this quantification method for the ecophysiological roles of individual cells, our study opens a variety of possibilities of research in environmental microbiology, especially by increasing the ability to examine the ecophysiological roles of individual cells, including those of less abundant and less active microbes, and by the capacity to track not only nitrogen and carbon but also phosphorus, sulfur, and other biological element flows within microbial communities.},

Heterotrophic bacteria maintain their activity at a baseline level during the extremely low energy conditions of the winter, but little is known about the specific phylotypes that have the potential to survive and grow in such harsh environment. In this study, we aimed at identifying actively growing ribotypes in winter Arctic Ocean seawater cultures by experimental incubations with the thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), followed by immunocapturing, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) fingerprinting, cloning and sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. We incubated water collected at different months over the Arctic winter and showed that the actively growing bacterial fraction, taking up BrdU, represented only a subset of the total community. Among the BrdU-labeled bacterial taxa we identified the Flavobacteria Polaribacter, the Alphaproteobacteria SAR11, the Gammaproteobacteria Arctic 96B-16 cluster and, predominately, members of Colwellia spp. Interestingly, Colwellia sequences formed three clusters (93 and 97\% pairwise 16S rRNA identity) that contributed in contrasting ways to the active communities in the incubations. Polaribacter, Arctic 96B-16 and one cluster of Colwellia were more abundant in the active community represented by the BrdU labelled DNA. In contrast, SAR11 and two other Colwellia clusters were underrepresented in the BrdU labelled community compared to total communities. Despite the limitation of the long incubations needed to label slow growing arctic communities, the BrdU approach revealed the potential for active growth in low-energy conditions in some relevant groups of polar bacteria, including Polaribacter and Arctic 96B-16. Moreover, under similar incubation conditions, the growth of different Colwellia ribotypes varied, suggesting that related clusters of Colwellia may have distinct metabolic features.},

HR-SIP was highly specific and moderately sensitive, with very few false positives but potential for false negatives. In contrast, q-SIP had fewer false negatives but many false positives. We also found HR-SIP more robust than q-SIP with respect to experimental variance. Furthermore, we found that the detection sensitivity of HTS-DNA-SIP can be increased without compromising specificity by evaluating evidence of isotope incorporation over multiple windows of buoyant density (MW-HR-SIP).

These noncultivated diazotrophs remain uncharacterized, as do their contributions to nitrogen fixation in natural systems. We have employed a novel 15N2-DNA stable isotope probing (5N2-DNA-SIP) method to identify free-living diazotrophs in soil that are responsible for nitrogen fixation in situ. Analyses of 16S rRNA genes from 15N-labeled DNA provide evidence for nitrogen fixation by three microbial groups, one of which belongs to the Rhizobiales while the other two represent deeply divergent lineages of noncultivated bacteria within the Betaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria, respectively. Analysis of nifH genes from 15N-labeled DNA also revealed three microbial groups, one of which was associated with Alphaproteobacteria while the others were associated with two noncultivated groups that are deeply divergent within nifH cluster I. These results reveal that noncultivated free-living diazotrophs can mediate nitrogen fixation in soils and that 15N2-DNA-SIP can be used to gain access to DNA from these organisms. In addition, this research provides the first evidence for nitrogen fixation by Actinobacteria outside of the order Actinomycetales.},

  abstract = {Most environments harbor large numbers of microbial taxa with ecologies that remain poorly described and characterizing the functional capabilities of whole communities remains a key challenge in microbial ecology. Shotgun metagenomic analyses are increasingly recognized as a powerful tool to understand community-level attributes. However, much of this data is under-utilized due, in part, to a lack of conceptual strategies for linking the metagenomic data to the most relevant community-level characteristics. Microbial ecologists could benefit by borrowing the concept of community-aggregated traits (CATs) from plant ecologists to glean more insight from the ever-increasing amount of metagenomic data being generated. CATs can be used to quantify the mean and variance of functional traits found in a given community. A CAT-based strategy will often yield far more useful information for predicting the functional attributes of diverse microbial communities and changes in those attributes than the more commonly-used analytical strategies. A more careful consideration of what CATs to measure and how they can be quantified from metagenomic data, will help build a more integrated understanding of complex microbial communities.},

The matrix of environment\textendash{}trait interaction coefficients is the fourth corner. We illustrate that compared with existing approaches to the fourth-corner problem, the proposed model-based approach has advantages in interpretability and its capacity to perform model selection and make predictions. To illustrate the method we used a generalized linear model with a LASSO penalty, fitted to data sets from four different studies requiring different models, illustrating the flexibility of the proposed approach. Predictive performance of the model is compared with that of fitting SDMs separately to each species, and in each case, it is shown that the trait model, despite being much simpler, had comparable predictive performance, even significantly outperforming separate SDMs in some cases.},

Here I briefly explain the proposed mechanistic basis of the model: natural selection occurring between individuals of different species. If trait differences are linked to differential demographic probabilities (i.e. fitness differences) then natural selection will constrain the average trait values found in the community and such average (`community-aggregated') traits will then possess information that is translated into the maximum entropy probabilities. If community assembly is strictly neutral then the maxent model will have no predictive ability. This also justifies the null model, and the permutation test, proposed by Roxburgh and Mokany.},

  abstract = {The high diversity of microbial communities hampers predictions about their responses to global change. Here we investigate the potential for using a phylogenetic, trait-based framework to capture the response of bacteria and fungi to global change manipulations. Replicated grassland plots were subjected to 3+ years of drought and nitrogen fertilization. The responses of leaf litter bacteria and fungi to these simulated changes were significantly phylogenetically conserved. Proportional changes in abundance were highly correlated among related organisms, such that relatives with approximately 5\% ribosomal DNA genetic distance showed similar responses to the treatments. A microbe's change in relative abundance was significantly correlated between the treatments, suggesting a compromise between numerical abundance in undisturbed environments and resistance to change in general, independent of disturbance type. Lineages in which at least 90\% of the microbes shared the same response were circumscribed at a modest phylogenetic depth ({$\tau$}D 0.014\textendash{}0.021), but significantly larger than randomized simulations predict. In several clades, phylogenetic depth of trait consensus was higher. Fungal response to drought was more conserved than was response to nitrogen fertilization, whereas bacteria responded equally to both treatments. Finally, we show that a bacterium's response to the manipulations is correlated with its potential functional traits (measured here as the number of glycoside hydrolase genes encoding the capacity to degrade different types of carbohydrates). Together, these results suggest that a phylogenetic, trait-based framework may be useful for predicting shifts in microbial composition and functioning in the face of global change.},

  volume = {109},

  abstract = {As the earth system changes in response to human activities, a critical objective is to predict how biogeochemical process rates (e.g. nitrification, decomposition) and ecosystem function (e.g. net ecosystem productivity) will change under future conditions. A particular challenge is that the microbial communities that drive many of these processes are capable of adapting to environmental change in ways that alter ecosystem functioning. Despite evidence that microbes can adapt to temperature, precipitation regimes, and redox fluctuations, microbial communities are typically not optimally adapted to their local environment. For example, temperature optima for growth and enzyme activity are often greater than in situ temperatures in their environment. Here we discuss fundamental constraints on microbial adaptation and suggest specific environments where microbial adaptation to climate change (or lack thereof) is most likely to alter ecosystem functioning. Our framework is based on two principal assumptions. First, there are fundamental ecological trade-offs in microbial community traits that occur across environmental gradients (in time and space). These trade-offs result in shifting of microbial function (e.g. ability to take up resources at low temperature) in response to adaptation of another trait (e.g. limiting maintenance respiration at high temperature). Second, the mechanism and level of microbial community adaptation to changing environmental parameters is a function of the potential rate of change in community composition relative to the rate of environmental change. Together, this framework provides a basis for developing testable predictions about how the rate and degree of microbial adaptation to climate change will alter biogeochemical processes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems across the planet.},

  abstract = {One primary goal at the intersection of community ecology and global change biology is to identify functional traits that are useful for predicting plant community response to global change. We used observations of community composition from a long-term field experiment in two adjacent plant communities (grassland and coastal sage shrub) to investigate how nine key plant functional traits were related to altered water and nitrogen availability following fire. We asked whether the functional responses of species found in more than one community type were context dependent and whether community-weighted mean and functional diversity were significantly altered by water and nitrogen input. Our results suggest varying degrees of context dependency. We found that plants with high leaf nitrogen concentration (specifically nitrogen fixers), shallow roots, and low leaf mass per unit area and plant-level transpiration were similarly negatively influenced by added nitrogen across community types. In contrast, responses to water manipulations exhibited greater context dependency; plants with high water-use efficiency, lower plant-level transpiration rates, and shallower roots were negatively impacted by simulated drought in the shrub-dominated community, but there was no significant relationship between these traits and changes in water inputs in the grassland community. Similarly, we found context dependency in community-wide trait responses to global change. Functional diversity tended to be higher in plots with reduced water as compared to those with added water in grassland, while the opposite trend was observed in coastal sage scrub. Our results indicate that some traits are strong predictors of species and community response to altered water and nitrogen availability, but the magnitude and direction of the response may be modulated by the abiotic and biotic context.},

  abstract = {Question Quantification of the effect of species traits on the assembly of communities is challenging from a statistical point of view. A key question is how species occurrence and abundance can be explained by the trait values of the species and the environmental values at the sites. Methods Using a sites \texttimes{} species abundance table, a site \texttimes{} environment data table and a species \texttimes{} trait data table, we address the above question using a novel generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) approach. The GLMM overcomes problems of pseudo-replication and heteroscedastic variance by including sites and species as random factors. The method is equally applicable to presence\textendash{}absence data as to count and multinomial data. We present a tiered forward selection approach for obtaining a parsimonious model and compare the results with alternative methods (the fourth corner method and RLQ ordination). Results We illustrate the approach on a presence\textendash{}absence version on two data sets. In the Dune Meadow data, species presence is parsimoniously explained by moisture and manure on the meadows in combination with seed mass and specific leaf area (SLA). In the Grazed Grassland data, species presence is parsimoniously explained by the grazing intensity and soil phosphorus in combination with the C:N ratio and flowering mode. Conclusions Our GLMM approach can be used to identify which species traits and environmental variables best explain the species distribution, and which traits are significantly correlated with environmental variables. We argue that the method is better suited for providing an interpretable and predictive model than the fourth corner method and RLQ.},

The phylogenetic conservatism of microbial traits has prompted the application of phylogeny-based algorithms to predict unknown trait values of extant taxa based on the traits of their evolutionary relatives to estimate, for instance, rRNA gene copy numbers, gene contents or tolerance to abiotic conditions. Unlike the `macrobial' world, microbial ecologists face scenarios potentially compromising the accuracy of trait reconstruction methods, as, for example, extremely large phylogenies and limited information on the traits of interest. We review 990 bacterial and archaeal traits from the literature and support that phylogenetic trait conservatism is widespread through the tree of life, while revealing that it is generally weak for ecologically relevant phenotypic traits and high for genetically complex traits. We then perform a simulation exercise to assess the accuracy of phylogeny-based trait predictions in common scenarios faced by microbial ecologists. Our simulations show that ca. 60\% of the variation in phylogeny-based trait predictions depends on the magnitude of the trait conservatism, the number of species in the tree, the proportion of species with unknown trait values and the mean distance in the tree to the nearest neighbour with a known trait value. Results are similar for both binary and continuous traits. We discuss these results under the light of the reviewed traits and provide recommendations for the use of phylogeny-based trait predictions for microbial ecologists.},

Further, emerging models emphasize the stabilization of microbial-derived SOM by abiotic mechanisms, while the effects of microbial physiology on microbial residue production remain unclear. Here we provide the first direct evidence that soil microbes produce chemically diverse, stable SOM.

  abstract = {Although researchers have begun cataloging the incredible diversity of bacteria found in soil, we are largely unable to interpret this information in an ecological context, including which groups of bacteria are most abundant in different soils and why. With this study, we examined how the abundances of major soil bacterial phyla correspond to the biotic and abiotic characteristics of the soil environment to determine if they can be divided into ecologically meaningful categories. To do this, we collected 71 unique soil samples from a wide range of ecosystems across North America and looked for relationships between soil properties and the relative abundances of six dominant bacterial phyla (Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, {$\alpha$}-Proteobacteria, and the {$\beta$}-Proteobacteria). Of the soil properties measured, net carbon (C) mineralization rate (an index of C availability) was the best predictor of phylum-level abundances. There was a negative correlation between Acidobacteria abundance and C mineralization rates (r2 = 0.26, P {$<$} 0.001), while the abundances of {$\beta$}-Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were positively correlated with C mineralization rates (r2 = 0.35, P {$<$} 0.001 and r2 = 0.34, P {$<$} 0.001, respectively). These patterns were explored further using both experimental and meta-analytical approaches. We amended soil cores from a specific site with varying levels of sucrose over a 12-month period to maintain a gradient of elevated C availabilities. This experiment confirmed our survey results: there was a negative relationship between C amendment level and the abundance of Acidobacteria (r2 = 0.42, P {$<$} 0.01) and a positive relationship for both Bacteroidetes and {$\beta$}-Proteobacteria (r2 = 0.38 and 0.70, respectively; P {$<$} 0.01 for each). Further support for a relationship between the relative abundances of these bacterial phyla and C availability was garnered from an analysis of published bacterial clone libraries from bulk and rhizosphere soils. Together our survey, experimental, and meta-analytical results suggest that certain bacterial phyla can be differentiated into copiotrophic and oligotrophic categories that correspond to the r- and K-selected categories used to describe the ecological attributes of plants and animals. By applying the copiotroph\textendash{}oligotroph concept to soil microorganisms we can make specific predictions about the ecological attributes of various bacterial taxa and better understand the structure and function of soil bacterial communities.},

  abstract = {The rate of information collection generated by metagenomics is uncoupled with its meaningful ecological interpretation. New analytical approaches based on functional trait-based ecology may help to bridge this gap and extend the trait approach to the community level in vast and complex environmental genetic data sets. Here, we explored a set of community traits that range from nucleotidic to genomic properties in 53 metagenomic aquatic samples from the Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) expedition. We found significant differences between the community profile derived from the commonly used 16S rRNA gene and from the functional trait set. The traits proved to be valuable ecological markers by discriminating between marine ecosystems (coastal vs. open ocean) and between oceans (Atlantic vs. Indian vs. Pacific). Intertrait relationships were also assessed, and we propose some that could be further used as habitat descriptors or indicators of artefacts during sample processing. Overall, the approach presented here may help to interpret metagenomics data to gain a full understanding of microbial community patterns in a rigorous ecological framework.},

  abstract = {1. The goal of conservation and restoration activities is to maintain biological diversity and the ecosystem services that this diversity provides. These activities traditionally focus on the measures of species diversity that include only information on the presence and abundance of species. Yet how diversity influences ecosystem function depends on the traits and niches filled by species. 2. Biological diversity can be quantified in ways that account for functional and phenotypic differences. A number of such measures of functional diversity (FD) have been created, quantifying the distribution of traits in a community or the relative magnitude of species similarities and differences. We review FD measures and why they are intuitively useful for understanding ecological patterns and are important for management. 3. In order for FD to be meaningful and worth measuring, it must be correlated with ecosystem function, and it should provide information above and beyond what species richness or diversity can explain. We review these two propositions, examining whether the strength of the correlation between FD and species richness varies across differing environmental gradients and whether FD offers greater explanatory power of ecosystem function than species richness. 4. Previous research shows that the relationship between FD and richness is complex and context dependent. Different functional traits can show individual responses to different gradients, meaning that important changes in diversity can occur with minimal change in richness. Further, FD can explain variation in ecosystem function even when richness does not. 5. Synthesis and applications. FD measures those aspects of diversity that potentially affect community assembly and function. Given this explanatory power, FD should be incorporated into conservation and restoration decision-making, especially for those efforts attempting to reconstruct or preserve healthy, functioning ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Metagenomics is a powerful tool that allows for the culture-independent analysis of complex microbial communities. One of the most complex and dense microbial ecosystems known is that of the human distal colon, with cell densities reaching up to 10(12) per gram of faeces. With the majority of species as yet uncultured, there are an enormous number of novel genes awaiting discovery. In the current study, we conducted a functional screen of a metagenomic library of the human gut microbiota for potential salt-tolerant clones. Using transposon mutagenesis, three genes were identified from a single clone exhibiting high levels of identity to a species from the genus Collinsella (closest relative being Collinsella aerofaciens) (COLAER\_01955, COLAER\_01957 and COLAER\_01981), a high G+C, Gram-positive member of the Actinobacteria commonly found in the human gut. The encoded proteins exhibit a strong similarity to GalE, MurB and MazG. Furthermore, pyrosequencing and bioinformatic analysis of two additional fosmid clones revealed the presence of an additional galE and mazG gene, with the highest level of genetic identity to Akkermansia muciniphila and Eggerthella sp. YY7918, respectively. Cloning and heterologous expression of the genes in the osmosensitive strain, Escherichia coli MKH13, resulted in increased salt tolerance of the transformed cells. It is hoped that the identification of atypical salt tolerance genes will help to further elucidate novel salt tolerance mechanisms, and will assist our increased understanding how resident bacteria cope with the osmolarity of the gastrointestinal tract.},

  abstract = {Microbial minimal generation times range from a few minutes to several weeks. They are evolutionarily determined by variables such as environment stability, nutrient availability, and community diversity. Selection for fast growth adaptively imprints genomes, resulting in gene amplification, adapted chromosomal organization, and biased codon usage. We found that these growth-related traits in 214 species of bacteria and archaea are highly correlated, suggesting they all result from growth optimization. While modeling their association with maximal growth rates in view of synthetic biology applications, we observed that codon usage biases are better correlates of growth rates than any other trait, including rRNA copy number. Systematic deviations to our model reveal two distinct evolutionary processes. First, genome organization shows more evolutionary inertia than growth rates. This results in over-representation of growth-related traits in fast degrading genomes. Second, selection for these traits depends on optimal growth temperature: for similar generation times purifying selection is stronger in psychrophiles, intermediate in mesophiles, and lower in thermophiles. Using this information, we created a predictor of maximal growth rate adapted to small genome fragments. We applied it to three metagenomic environmental samples to show that a transiently rich environment, as the human gut, selects for fast-growers, that a toxic environment, as the acid mine biofilm, selects for low growth rates, whereas a diverse environment, like the soil, shows all ranges of growth rates. We also demonstrate that microbial colonizers of babies gut grow faster than stabilized human adults gut communities. In conclusion, we show that one can predict maximal growth rates from sequence data alone, and we propose that such information can be used to facilitate the manipulation of generation times. Our predictor allows inferring growth rates in the vast majority of uncultivable prokaryotes and paves the way to the understanding of community dynamics from metagenomic data.},

  abstract = {Although the evolution process and ecological benefits of symbiotic species with small genomes are well understood, these issues remain poorly elucidated for free-living species with large genomes. We have compared 115 completed prokaryotic genomes by using the Clusters of Orthologous Groups database to determine whether there are changes with genome size in the proportion of the genome attributable to particular cellular processes, because this may reflect both cellular and ecological strategies associated with genome expansion. We found that large genomes are disproportionately enriched in regulation and secondary metabolism genes and depleted in protein translation, DNA replication, cell division, and nucleotide metabolism genes compared to medium- and small-sized genomes. Furthermore, large genomes do not accumulate noncoding DNA or hypothetical ORFs, because the portion of the genome devoted to these functions remained constant with genome size. Traits other than genome size or strain-specific processes are reflected by the dispersion around the mean for cell functions that showed no correlation with genome size. For example, Archaea had significantly more genes in energy production, coenzyme metabolism, and the poorly characterized category, and fewer in cell membrane biogenesis and carbohydrate metabolism than Bacteria. The trends we noted with genome size by using Clusters of Orthologous Groups were confirmed by our independent analysis with The Institute for Genomic Research's Comprehensive Microbial Resource and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes' Orthology annotation databases. These trends suggest that larger genome-sized species may dominate in environments where resources are scarce but diverse and where there is little penalty for slow growth, such as soil.},

Agricultural intensification is a major driver of biodiversity loss and has multiple components operating at different spatial scales: from in-field management intensity to landscape-scale simplification. Here we show that landscape-level effects dominate functional community composition and can even buffer the effects of in-field management intensification on functional homogenization, and that animal communities in real-world managed landscapes show a unified response (across orders and guilds) to both landscape-scale simplification and in-field intensification. Adults and larvae with specialized feeding habits, species with shorter activity periods and relatively small body sizes are selected against in simplified landscapes with intense in-field management. Our results demonstrate that the diversity of land cover types at the landscape scale is critical for maintaining communities, which are functionally diverse, even in landscapes where in-field management intensity is high.},

  abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that soil microbial diversity affects ecosystem function by evaluating the effect of denitrifier community composition on nitrous oxide (N2O) production. Denitrification is a major source of atmospheric N2O, an important greenhouse gas and a natural catalyst of stratospheric ozone decay. The major environmental controls on denitrification rate and the mole ratio of N2O produced during denitrification have been incorporated into mechanistic models, but these models are, in general, poor predictors of in situ N2O flux rates. We sampled two geomorphically similar soils from fields in southwest Michigan that differed in plant community composition and disturbance regime: a conventionally tilled agricultural field and a never-tilled successional field. We tested whether denitrifier community composition influences denitrification rate and the relative rate of N2O production [{$\bigtriangleup$}N2O/{$\bigtriangleup$}(N2O + N2)], or rN2O, using a soil enzyme assay designed to evaluate the effect of oxygen concentration and pH on the activity of denitrification enzymes responsible for the production and consumption of N2O. By controlling, or providing in nonlimiting amounts, all known environmental regulators of denitrifier N2O production and consumption, we created conditions in which the only variable contributing to differences in denitrification rate and rN2O in the two soils was denitrifier community composition. We found that both denitrification rate and rN2O differed for the two soils under controlled incubation conditions. Oxygen inhibited the activity of enzymes involved in N2O production (nitrate reductase, Nar; nitrite reductase, Nir; and nitric oxide reductase, Nor) to a greater extent in the denitrifying community from the agricultural field than in the community from the successional field. The Nar, Nir, and Nor enzymes of the denitrifying community from the successional field, on the other hand, were more sensitive to pH than were those in the denitrifying community from the agricultural field. Moreover, the denitrifying community in the soil from the successional field had relatively more active nitrous oxide reductase (Nos) enzymes, which reduce N2O to N2, than the denitrifying community in the agricultural field. Also, the shape of the rN2O curve with increasing oxygen was different for each denitrifying community. Each of these differences suggests that the denitrifying communities in these two soils are different and that they do not respond to environmental regulators in the same manner. We thus conclude that native microbial community composition regulates an important ecosystem function in these soils.},

  title = {Nutrient Limitation and Soil Development: {{Experimental}} Test of a Biogeochemical Theory},
  abstract = {Walker and Syers (1976) proposed a conceptual model that describes the pattern and regulation of soil nutrient pools and availability during long-term soil and ecosystem development. Their model implies that plant production generally should be limited by N on young soils and by P on old soils; N and P supply should more or less equilibrate on intermediate-aged soils. We tested the application of this model to nutrient limitation, using a well characterized substrate age sequence in Hawaiian montane rain forest. Earlier experiments had evaluated nutrient limitation in forests on a young (300 y) and an old (4,100,000 y) substrate on the same developmental sequence; N alone limited tree growth on the young substrate, while P alone did so on the old one. An additional fertilizer experiment based on replicated treatments with N, P, and all other nutrients combined, applied in individually and in all factorial combinations, was established in an intermediate-aged site in the Laupahoehoe Forest Reserve, Hawaii. Here, diameter increments of the dominant tree Metrosideros polymorpha increased slightly with N additions, and nearly doubled when N and P were added together. Additions of elements other than N and P had no significant effect on growth. These results show that N and P had equilibrated (relative to plant requirements) in the intermediate aged site. Together with the earlier experiments, these results suggest that the Walker and Syers model provides a useful starting point for explaining the nature and distribution of nutrient limitation in forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Experimental investigations of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) directly manipulate diversity then monitor ecosystem response to the manipulation. While these studies have generally confirmed the importance of biodiversity to the functioning of ecosystems, their broader significance has been difficult to interpret. The main reasons for this difficulty concern the small scales of the experiment, a bias towards plants and grasslands, and most importantly a general lack of clarity in terms of what attributes of functional diversity (FD) were actually manipulated. We review how functional traits, functional groups, and the relationship between functional and taxonomic diversity have been used in current BEF research. Several points emerged from our review. First, it is critical to distinguish between response and effect functional traits when quantifying or manipulating FD. Second, although it is widely done, using trophic position as a functional group designator does not fit the effect-response trait division needed in BEF research. Third, determining a general relationship between taxonomic and FD is neither necessary nor desirable in BEF research. Fourth, fundamental principles in community and biogeographical ecology that have been largely ignored in BEF research could serve to dramatically improve the scope and predictive capabilities of BEF research. We suggest that distinguishing between functional response traits and functional effect traits both in combinatorial manipulations of biodiversity and in descriptive studies of BEF could markedly improve the power of such studies. We construct a possible framework for predictive, broad-scale BEF research that requires integrating functional, community, biogeographical, and ecosystem ecology with taxonomy.},

  abstract = {Bacteria grow and transform elements at different rates, and as yet, quantifying this variation in the environment is difficult. Determining isotope enrichment with fine taxonomic resolution after exposure to isotope tracers could help, but there are few suitable techniques. We propose a modification to stable isotope probing (SIP) that enables the isotopic composition of DNA from individual bacterial taxa after exposure to isotope tracers to be determined. In our modification, after isopycnic centrifugation, DNA is collected in multiple density fractions, and each fraction is sequenced separately. Taxon-specific density curves are produced for labeled and nonlabeled treatments, from which the shift in density for each individual taxon in response to isotope labeling is calculated. Expressing each taxon's density shift relative to that taxon's density measured without isotope enrichment accounts for the influence of nucleic acid composition on density and isolates the influence of isotope tracer assimilation. The shift in density translates quantitatively to isotopic enrichment. Because this revision to SIP allows quantitative measurements of isotope enrichment, we propose to call it quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP). We demonstrated qSIP using soil incubations, in which soil bacteria exhibited strong taxonomic variations in 18O and 13C composition after exposure to [18O]water or [13C]glucose. The addition of glucose increased the assimilation of 18O into DNA from [18O]water. However, the increase in 18O assimilation was greater than expected based on utilization of glucose-derived carbon alone, because the addition of glucose indirectly stimulated bacteria to utilize other substrates for growth. This example illustrates the benefit of a quantitative approach to stable isotope probing.},

Using a global-scale compilation of {$\sim$}35,000 sites and {$\sim$}5.6{$\cdot$}106 species, including the largest ever inventory of high-throughput molecular data and one of the largest compilations of plant and animal community data, we show similar rates of scaling in commonness and rarity across microorganisms and macroscopic plants and animals. We document a universal dominance scaling law that holds across 30 orders of magnitude, an unprecedented expanse that predicts the abundance of dominant ocean bacteria. In combining this scaling law with the lognormal model of biodiversity, we predict that Earth is home to upward of 1 trillion (1012) microbial species.

  abstract = {Our growing awareness of the microbial world's importance and diversity contrasts starkly with our limited understanding of its fundamental structure. Despite recent advances in DNA sequencing, a lack of standardized protocols and common analytical frameworks impedes comparisons among studies, hindering the development of global inferences about microbial life on Earth. Here we present a meta-analysis of microbial community samples collected by hundreds of researchers for the Earth Microbiome Project. Coordinated protocols and new analytical methods, particularly the use of exact sequences instead of clustered operational taxonomic units, enable bacterial and archaeal ribosomal RNA gene sequences to be followed across multiple studies and allow us to explore patterns of diversity at an unprecedented scale. The result is both a reference database giving global context to DNA sequence data and a framework for incorporating data from future studies, fostering increasingly complete characterization of Earth's microbial diversity.},

  abstract = {The research of a generation of ecologists was catalysed by the recognition that the number and identity of species in communities influences the functioning of ecosystems. The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) is most often examined by controlling species richness and randomising community composition. In natural systems, biodiversity changes are often part of a bigger community assembly dynamic. Therefore, focusing on community assembly and the functioning of ecosystems (CAFE), by integrating both species richness and composition through species gains, losses and changes in abundance, will better reveal how community changes affect ecosystem function. We synthesise the BEF and CAFE perspectives using an ecological application of the Price equation, which partitions the contributions of richness and composition to function. Using empirical examples, we show how the CAFE approach reveals important contributions of composition to function. These examples show how changes in species richness and composition driven by environmental perturbations can work in concert or antagonistically to influence ecosystem function. Considering how communities change in an integrative fashion, rather than focusing on one axis of community structure at a time, will improve our ability to anticipate and predict changes in ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {Fungi influence nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, as they are major regulators of decomposition and soil respiration. However, little is known about the substrate preferences of individual fungal species outside of laboratory culture studies. If active fungi differ in their substrate preferences in situ, then changes in fungal diversity due to global change may dramatically influence nutrient cycling in ecosystems. To test the responses of individual fungal taxa to specific substrates, we used a nucleotide-analogue procedure in the boreal forest of Alaska (USA). Specifically, we added four organic N compounds commonly found in plant litter (arginine, glutamate, lignocellulose, and tannin\textendash{}protein) to litterbags filled with decomposed leaf litter (black spruce and aspen) and assessed the responses of active fungal species using qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction), oligonucleotide fingerprinting of rRNA genes, and sequencing. We also compared the sequences from our experiment with a concurrent warming experiment to see if active fungi that targeted more recalcitrant compounds would respond more positively to soil warming. We found that individual fungal taxa responded differently to substrate additions and that active fungal communities were different across litter types (spruce vs. aspen). Active fungi that targeted lignocellulose also responded positively to experimental warming. Additionally, resource-use patterns in different fungal taxa were genetically correlated, suggesting that it may be possible to predict the ecological function of active fungal communities based on genetic information. Together, these results imply that fungi are functionally diverse and that reductions in fungal diversity may have consequences for ecosystem functioning.},

  abstract = {Analysis of patterns in the distribution of taxa can provide important insights into ecological and evolutionary processes. Microbial biogeographic patterns almost always appear to be weaker than those reported for plant and animal taxa. It is as yet unclear why this is the case. Some argue that microbial diversity scales differently over space because microbial taxa are fundamentally different in their abundance, longevity and dispersal abilities. Others have argued that differences in scaling are an artifact of how we assess microbial biogeography, driven, for example, by differences in taxonomic resolution, spatial scale, sampling effort or community activity/dormancy. We tested these alternative explanations by comparing bacterial biogeographic patterns in soil to those of trees found in a forest in Gabon. Altering taxonomic resolution, excluding inactive individuals, or adjusting for differences in spatial scale were insufficient to change the rate of microbial taxonomic turnover. In contrast, we account for the differences in spatial turnover between these groups by equalizing sampling extent. Our results suggest that spatial scaling differences between microbial and plant diversity are likely not due to fundamental differences in biology, and that sampling extent should be taken into account when comparing the biogeographic patterns of microorganisms and larger organisms.},

  abstract = {The analysis of human microbiome data is often based on dimension-reduced graphical displays and clusterings derived from vectors of microbial abundances in each sample. Common to these ordination methods is the use of biologically motivated definitions of similarity. Principal coordinate analysis, in particular, is often performed using ecologically defined distances, allowing analyses to incorporate context-dependent, non-Euclidean structure. In this paper, we go beyond dimension-reduced ordination methods and describe a framework of high-dimensional regression models that extends these distance-based methods. In particular, we use kernel-based methods to show how to incorporate a variety of extrinsic information, such as phylogeny, into penalized regression models that estimate taxon-specific associations with a phenotype or clinical outcome. Further, we show how this regression framework can be used to address the compositional nature of multivariate predictors comprised of relative abundances; that is, vectors whose entries sum to a constant. We illustrate this approach with several simulations using data from two recent studies on gut and vaginal microbiomes. We conclude with an application to our own data, where we also incorporate a significance test for the estimated coefficients that represent associations between microbial abundance and a percent fat.},

Although the majority of mouse gut species are unique, the mouse and human microbiota(s) are similar at the division (superkingdom) level, with Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes dominating. Microbial-community composition is inherited from mothers. However, compared with lean mice and regardless of kinship, ob/ob animals have a 50\% reduction in the abundance of Bacteroidetes and a proportional increase in Firmicutes. These changes, which are division-wide, indicate that, in this model, obesity affects the diversity of the gut microbiota and suggest that intentional manipulation of community structure may be useful for regulating energy balance in obese individuals.},

  abstract = {We present 6.5 years of eddy covariance measurements of fluxes of methane (FCH4) and carbon dioxide (FCO2) from a flooded rice paddy in Northern California, USA. A pronounced warming trend throughout the study associated with drought and record high temperatures strongly influenced carbon (C) budgets and provided insights into biophysical controls of FCO2 and FCH4. Wavelet analysis indicated that photosynthesis (gross ecosystem production, GEP) induced the diel pattern in FCH4, but soil temperature (Ts) modulated its amplitude. Forward stepwise linear models and neural networking modeling were used to assess the variables regulating seasonal FCH4. As expected due to their competence in modeling nonlinear relationships, neural network models explained considerably more of the variance in daily average FCH4 than linear models. During the growing season, GEP and water levels typically explained most of the variance in daily average FCH4. However, Ts explained much of the interannual variability in annual and growing season CH4 sums. Higher Ts also increased the annual and growing season ratio of FCH4 to GEP. The observation that the FCH4 to GEP ratio scales predictably with Ts may help improve global estimates of FCH4 from rice agriculture. Additionally, Ts strongly influenced ecosystem respiration, resulting in large interannual variability in the net C budget at the paddy, emphasizing the need for long-term measurements particularly under changing climatic conditions.},

Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.},

  abstract = {There has been an explosion of research on host-associated microbial communities (i.e.,microbiomes). Much of this research has focused on surveys of microbial diversities across a variety of host species, including humans, with a view to understanding how these microbiomes are distributed across space and time, and how they correlate with host health, disease, phenotype, physiology and ecology. Fewer studies have focused on how these microbiomes may have evolved. In this paper, we develop an agent-based framework to study the dynamics of microbiome evolution. Our framework incorporates neutral models of how hosts acquire their microbiomes, and how the environmental microbial community that is available to the hosts is assembled. Most importantly, our framework also incorporates a Wright-Fisher genealogical model of hosts, so that the dynamics of microbiome evolution is studied on an evolutionary timescale. Our results indicate that the extent of parental contribution to microbial availability from one generation to the next significantly impacts the diversity of microbiomes: the greater the parental contribution, the less diverse the microbiomes. In contrast, even when there is only a very small contribution from a constant environmental pool, microbial communities can remain highly diverse. Finally, we show that our models may be used to construct hypotheses about the types of processes that operate to assemble microbiomes over evolutionary time.},

  shorttitle = {Methane Emissions from Wetlands},
  abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of methane (CH4) emissions is of paramount importance because CH4 has 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide (CO2) and is currently the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas. Wetlands are the single largest natural CH4 source with median emissions from published studies of 164 Tg yr{\`A}1, which is about a third of total global emissions. We provide a perspective on important new frontiers in obtaining a better understanding of CH4 dynamics in natural systems, with a focus on wetlands. One of the most exciting recent developments in this field is the attempt to integrate the different methodologies and spatial scales of biogeochemistry, molecular microbiology, and modeling, and thus this is a major focus of this review. Our specific objectives are to provide an up-to-date synthesis of estimates of global CH4 emissions from wetlands and other freshwater aquatic ecosystems, briefly summarize major biogeophysical controls over CH4 emissions from wetlands, suggest new frontiers in CH4 biogeochemistry, examine relationships between methanogen community structure and CH4 dynamics in situ, and to review the current generation of CH4 models. We highlight throughout some of the most pressing issues concerning global change and feedbacks on CH4 emissions from natural ecosystems. Major uncertainties in estimating current and future CH4 emissions from natural ecosystems include the following: (i) A number of important controls over CH4 production, consumption, and transport have not been, or are inadequately, incorporated into existing CH4 biogeochemistry models. (ii) Significant errors in regional and global emission estimates are derived from large spatial-scale extrapolations from highly heterogeneous and often poorly mapped wetland complexes. (iii) The limited number of observations of CH4 fluxes and their associated environmental variables loosely constrains the parameterization of process-based biogeochemistry models.},

  abstract = {Global atmospheric methane (CH4) concentrations are now approaching 1800~ppbv as a result of the growing imbalance between the net CH4 emissions from natural and anthropogenic sources of this potent greenhouse gas, and its consumption by physical and biological processes. The main focus of this review is on how land-use change and soil management can be used to correct this imbalance. Currently, the main terrestrial source for CH4 is from natural wetlands and irrigated rice cultivation, although improvements in water management during rice production have resulted in major reductions of CH4 emissions from this source. Afforestation and reforestation can also enhance soil CH4 oxidation by influencing the composition and activity of the soil methanotroph (aerobic proteobacteria) community. The effects of these and other land-use changes on soil CH4 oxidation are not generally well understood, but are known to influence this process through their effects on a range of soil properties such as soil moisture, nitrogen status, and pH that also affects methanotroph community structure and function. Recent advances in molecular techniques have confirmed the central role of methanotroph communities in regulating soil CH4 consumption by revealing how they respond to land-use change. Community-level molecular analyses of methanotroph populations under different conditions now provide new insights into the distinct traits of the different subgroups and their ecology. These advances in understanding the abiotic and biological processes regulating soil CH4 oxidation now offers the possibility of being able to predict which land-use and management practices, especially for afforestation and reforestation, will achieve high soil CH4 oxidation rates They also improve the prospects for integrated assessment of the atmospheric impacts on the global greenhouse gas budget from net soil emissions of CH4, N2O, and CO2 with land use and management change.},

  abstract = {Afforestation and reforestation of pastures are key land-use changes in New Zealand that help sequester carbon (C) to offset its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. However, relatively little attention has been given so far to associated changes in trace gas fluxes. Here, we measure methane (CH4) fluxes and CO2 production, as well as microbial C, nitrogen (N) and mineral-N, in intact, gradually dried (ca. 2 months at 20\textdegree{}C) cores of a volcanic soil and a heavier textured, non-volcanic soil collected within plantations of Pinus radiata D. Don (pine) and adjacent permanent pastures. CH4 fluxes and CO2 production were also measured in cores of another volcanic soil under reverting shrubland (mainly Kunzea var. ericoides (A. Rich) J. Thompson) and an adjacent pasture. CH4 uptake in the pine and shrubland cores of the volcanic soils at field capacity averaged about 35 and 14{$\mu$}g CH4\textendash{}Cm-2h-1, respectively, and was significantly higher than in the pasture cores (about 21 and 6{$\mu$}g CH4\textendash{}Cm-2h-1, respectively). In the non-volcanic soil, however, CH4\textendash{}C uptake was similar in most cores of the pine and pasture soils, averaging about 7\textendash{}9{$\mu$}gm-2h-1, except in very wet samples. In contrast, rates of CO2 production and microbial C and N concentrations were significantly lower under pine than under pasture. In the air-dry cores, microbial C and N had declined in the volcanic soil, but not in the non-volcanic soil; ammonium\textendash{}N, and especially nitrate\textendash{}N, had increased significantly in all samples. CH4 uptake was, with few exceptions, not significantly influenced by initial concentrations of ammonium\textendash{}N or nitrate\textendash{}N, nor by their changes on air-drying. A combination of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and stable isotope probing (SIP) analyses of only the pine and pasture soils showed that different methanotrophic communities were probably active in soils under the different vegetations. The C18 PLFAs (type II methanotrophs) predominated under pine and C16 PLFAs (type I methanotrophs) predominated under pasture. Overall, vegetation, soil texture, and water-filled pore space influenced CH4\textendash{}C uptake more than did soil mineral-N concentrations.},

Considering scales of interaction beyond the level of the individual host could lead to new insights. Metacommunity theory has many of the tools necessary for modeling multiscale processes and has been successfully applied to host microbiomes. However, the biotic nature of the host requires an expansion of theory to incorporate feedback between the habitat patch (host) and their local (microbial) community. This feedback can have unexpected effects, is predicted to be common, and can arise through a variety of mechanisms, including developmental, ecological, and evolutionary processes. We propose a new way forward for both metacommunity theory and host microbiome research that incorporates this feedback.},

This debate is especially pertinent to microbial communities, which play crucial roles in areas such as health, disease, industry, and the environment. Here, we created a synthetic microbial community using heritable genetic barcodes and tracked community composition over repeated rounds of subculture with immigration. Consistent with theory, we find a transition exists between neutral and selective regimes, and the crossover point depends on the fraction of immigrants and the magnitude of fitness differences. Neutral models predict an increase in diversity with increased carrying capacity, while our selective model predicts a decrease in diversity. The community here lost diversity with an increase in carrying capacity, highlighting that using the correct model is essential for predicting community response to change. Together, these results emphasize the importance of including selection to obtain realistic models of even simple systems.},

  shorttitle = {Microbiota {{Transfer Therapy}} Alters Gut Ecosystem and Improves Gastrointestinal and Autism Symptoms},
  abstract = {Background: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are complex neurobiological disorders that impair social interactions and communication and lead to restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. The causes of these disorders remain poorly understood, but gut microbiota, the 1013 bacteria in the human intestines, have been implicated because children with ASD often suffer gastrointestinal (GI) problems that correlate with ASD severity. Several previous studies have reported abnormal gut bacteria in children with ASD. The gut microbiome-ASD connection has been tested in a mouse model of ASD, where the microbiome was mechanistically linked to abnormal metabolites and behavior. Similarly, a study of children with ASD found that oral non-absorbable antibiotic treatment improved GI and ASD symptoms, albeit temporarily. Here, a small open-label clinical trial evaluated the impact of Microbiota Transfer Therapy (MTT) on gut microbiota composition and GI and ASD symptoms of 18 ASD-diagnosed children.
Results: MTT involved a 2-week antibiotic treatment, a bowel cleanse, and then an extended fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) using a high initial dose followed by daily and lower maintenance doses for 7\textendash{}8 weeks. The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale revealed an approximately 80\% reduction of GI symptoms at the end of treatment, including significant improvements in symptoms of constipation, diarrhea, indigestion, and abdominal pain. Improvements persisted 8 weeks after treatment. Similarly, clinical assessments showed that behavioral ASD symptoms improved significantly and remained improved 8 weeks after treatment ended. Bacterial and phagedeep sequencing analyses revealed successful partial engraftment of donor microbiota and beneficial changes in the gut environment. Specifically, overall bacterial diversity and the abundance of Bifidobacterium, Prevotella, and Desulfovibrio among other taxa increased following MTT, and these changes persisted after treatment stopped (followed for 8 weeks).
Conclusions: This exploratory, extended-duration treatment protocol thus appears to be a promising approach to alter the gut microbiome and virome and improve GI and behavioral symptoms of ASD. Improvements in GI symptoms, ASD symptoms, and the microbiome all persisted for at least 8 weeks after treatment ended, suggesting a long-term impact. (Continued on next page)},

We demonstrate excellent consistency in taxonomic recovery and recapture diversity patterns that were previously reported on the basis of metaanalysis of many studies from the literature (notably, the saline/nonsaline split in environmental samples and the split between host-associated and free-living communities). We also demonstrate that 2,000 Illumina single-end reads are sufficient to recapture the same relationships among samples that we observe with the full dataset. The results thus open up the possibility of conducting large-scale studies analyzing thousands of samples simultaneously to survey microbial communities at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.},

We compared the diversity of plant, bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities in one hundred and forty-five 1 m2 plots across 25 temperate grassland sites from four continents. Across sites, the plant alpha diversity patterns were poorly related to those observed for any soil microbial group. However, plant beta diversity (compositional dissimilarity between sites) was significantly correlated with the beta diversity of bacterial and fungal communities, even after controlling for environmental factors. Thus, across a global range of temperate grasslands, plant diversity can predict patterns in the composition of soil microbial communities, but not patterns in alpha diversity.},

  title = {Soil Viruses Are Underexplored Players in Ecosystem Carbon Processing},
  abstract = {Rapidly thawing permafrost harbors ϳ30 to 50\% of global soil carbon, and the fate of this carbon remains unknown. Microorganisms will play a central role in its fate, and their viruses could modulate that impact via induced mortality and metabolic controls. Because of the challenges of recovering viruses from soils, little is known about soil viruses or their role(s) in microbial biogeochemical cycling. Here, we describe 53 viral populations (viral operational taxonomic units [vOTUs]) recovered from seven quantitatively derived (i.e., not multiple-displacement-amplified) viral-particle metagenomes (viromes) along a permafrost thaw gradient at the Stordalen Mire field site in northern Sweden. Only 15\% of these vOTUs had genetic similarity to publicly available viruses in the RefSeq database, and ϳ30\% of the genes could be annotated, supporting the concept of soils as reservoirs of substantial undescribed viral genetic diversity. The vOTUs exhibited distinct ecology, with different distributions along the thaw gradient habitats, and a shift from soil-viruslike assemblages in the dry palsas to aquatic-virus-like assemblages in the inundated fen. Seventeen vOTUs were linked to microbial hosts (in silico), implicating viruses in infecting abundant microbial lineages from Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Deltaproteobacteria, including those encoding key biogeochemical functions such as organic matter degradation. Thirty auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) were identified and suggested virus-mediated modulation of central carbon metabolism, soil organic matter degradation, polysaccharide binding, and regulation of sporulation. Together, these findings suggest that these soil viruses have distinct ecology, impact hostmediated biogeochemistry, and likely impact ecosystem function in the rapidly changing Arctic.},

  abstract = {A major thrust of terrestrial microbial ecology is focused on understanding when and how the composition of the microbial community affects the functioning of biogeochemical processes at the ecosystem scale (meters-to-kilometers and days-to-years). While research has demonstrated these linkages for physiologically and phylogenetically ``narrow'' processes such as trace gas emissions and nitrification, there is less conclusive evidence that microbial community composition influences the ``broad'' processes of decomposition and organic matter turnover in soil. In this paper, we consider how soil microbial community structure influences C-cycling. We consider the phylogenetic level at which microbes form meaningful guilds, based on overall life history strategies, and suggest that these are associated with deep evolutionary divergences, while much of the species-level diversity probably reflects functional redundancy. We then consider under what conditions it is possible for differences among microbes to affect process dynamics, and argue that while microbial community structure may be important in the rate of OM breakdown in the rhizosphere and in detritus, it is likely not important in the mineral soil. In mineral soil, physical access to occluded or sorbed substrates is the rate-limiting process. Microbial community influences on OM turnover in mineral soils are based on how organisms allocate the C they take up\textemdash{}not only do the fates of the molecules differ, but they can affect the soil system differently as well. For example, extracellular enzymes and extracellular polysaccharides can be key controls on soil structure and function. How microbes allocate C may also be particularly important for understanding the long-term fate of C in soil\textemdash{}is it sequestered or not?},

  issn = {1751-7370},
  abstract = {Most attempts to identify the processes that structure natural communities have focused on conspicuous macroorganisms whereas the processes responsible for structuring microbial communities remain relatively unknown. Two main theories explaining these processes have emerged; niche theory, which highlights the importance of deterministic processes, and neutral theory, which focuses on stochastic processes. We examined whether neutral or niche-based mechanisms best explain the composition and structure of communities of a functionally important soil microbe, the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Using molecular techniques, we surveyed AM fungi from 425 individual plants of 28 plant species along a soil pH gradient. There was evidence that both niche and neutral processes structured this community. Species abundances fitted the zero-sum multinomial distribution and there was evidence of dispersal limitation, both indicators of neutral processes. However, we found stronger support that niche differentiation based on abiotic soil factors, primarily pH, was structuring the AM fungal community. Host plant species affected AM fungal community composition negligibly compared to soil pH. We conclude that although niche partitioning was the primary mechanism regulating the composition and diversity of natural AM fungal communities, these communities are also influenced by stochastic-neutral processes. This study represents one of the most comprehensive investigations of community-level processes acting on soil microbes; revealing a community that although influenced by stochastic processes, still responded in a predictable manner to a major abiotic niche axis, soil pH. The strong response to environmental factors of this community highlights the susceptibility of soil microbes to environmental change.},

The spatial and temporal scales of microbial community assembly are also discussed in relation to assembly processes. Throughout this review paper, we highlight differences between microbes and macroorganisms and generate hypotheses describing how these differences may be important for community assembly.

  abstract = {Tree stems from wetland, floodplain and upland forests can produce and emit methane (CH4). Tree CH4 stem emissions have high spatial and temporal variability, but there is no consensus on the biophysical mechanisms that drive stem CH4 production and emissions. Here, we summarize up to 30 opportunities and challenges for stem CH4 emissions research, which when addressed will improve estimates of magnitudes, patterns, drivers and trace the potential origin of CH4 emissions. We identified the need (i) for both long-term high frequency measurements of stem CH4 emissions to understand the fine scale processes, alongside rapid large-scale measurements designed to understand variability across individuals, species and ecosystems; (ii) to identify microorganisms and biogeochemical pathways associated with CH4 production; and (iii) to develop a mechanistic model including passive and active transport of CH4 from the soil-tree-atmosphere continuum. Addressing these challenges would help to constrain magnitudes and patterns of CH4 emissions, and would allow for the integration of pathways and mechanisms of CH4 production and emissions into process-based models. These advances will facilitate upscaling of stem CH4 emissions to the ecosystem level and quantify the role of stem CH4 emissions for the local-to-global CH4 budget.

  volume = {6},
  issn = {2167-8359},
  abstract = {Wetlands are the major natural source of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) and are also potentially an important source of nitrous oxide (N2O), though there is considerable variability among wetland types with some of the greatest uncertainty in freshwater mineral-soil wetlands. In particular, trace gas emissions from seasonal wetlands have been very poorly studied. We measured fluxes of CH4, N2O, and CO2(carbon dioxide), soil nutrients, and net primary productivity over one year in natural, restored, and agricultural seasonal wetland prairies in the Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA. We found zero fluxes for CH4 and N2O, even during periods of extended waterlogging of the soil. To explore this lack of emissions, we performed a laboratory experiment to examine the controls over these gases. In a fully-factorial design, we amended anaerobic soils from all wetlands with nitrate, glucose, and NaOH (to neutralize pH) and measured production potentials of N2, N2O, CH4, and CO2. We found that denitrification and N2O production were co-limited by nitrate and carbon, with little difference between the three wetland types. This co-limitation suggests that low soil carbon availability will continue to constrain N2O emissions and denitrification in these systems even when receiving relatively high levels of nitrogen inputs. Contrary to the results for N2O, the amended wetland soils never produced significant amounts of CH4 under any treatment. We hypothesize that high concentrations of alternative electron acceptors exist in these soils so that methanogens are noncompetitive with other microbial groups. As a result, these wetlands do not appear to be a significant source or sink of soil carbon and thus have a near zero climate forcing effect. Future research should focus on determining if this is a generalizable result in other seasonal wetlands.},

  abstract = {The collection of microorganisms found in the root zone of soil, termed the rhizosphere microbiome, has been shown to impact plant growth and development. Here, we tease apart the function of the cultivable portion of the microbiome from the whole microbiome in retaining plant traits modified through artificial selection on flowering time. Specifically, the whole microbiome associated with earlier flowering time of Arabidopsis thaliana was cultivated on four types of solid media to create cultivated fractions of the microbiome. These cultivated microbiomes were subsequently preserved in glycerol, frozen, and revived to yield a portion of the cultivable fraction to compare (1) whole microbiome, (2) cultivable microbiome, and (3) revived, cultivable microbiome controls on early flowering time. Plants grown in soils inoculated with bacteria grown on 25 \% Luria broth and 10 \% tryptic soy agar retained the early flowering trait. An increase in leaf biomass with two of the cultivated microbiomes (49.4 and 38.5 \%) contrasted the lowered biomass effect of the whole microbiome. Inoculation with the cultivated microbiomes that were cryopreserved in glycerol showed no effect on flowering time or leaf biomass. The results indicate that the cultivable portion of a plant's microbiome retains the early flowering effect in A. thaliana, but cryopreservation of the cultivated microbiomes disrupts the microbial effects on flowering time. Furthermore, the contrasting effects on leaf biomass (an indirect response from selection on early flowering time), seen with the whole microbiome versus the cultivable portion, suggests versatility in using cultivation methods to modify multiple traits of plants.},

Values for enzyme specific activities were more highly correlated with community composition than were total enzyme activities. In addition, BIOLOG was not correlated with community composition or enzyme activities.

I argue they are not, if individualist models of community assembly are vindicated; i.e., if the presence of one species is not typically explained by the presence or absence of specific other species. I discuss two alternatives to individualism, and conclude by arguing for a dimensional model of phenomenological communities. The causal salience of a phenomenological community depends on three factors: the extent to which it is internally regulated, the extent to which it has robust boundaries, and the extent to which it has emergent properties. I conclude by using this model to frame a natural research agenda for community ecology.},

Plant transport was the dominant pathway of CH4 flux from this ecosystem. Most CH4 production (measured with in situ anaerobic incubations) occurred well below the water table, and C supply (estimated by anaerobic CO2 production) was the best single predictor of CH4 production rates. Plant transport of CH4 was controlled both by CH4 supply and the plant species. Eriophorum angustifolium transported substantially more CH4 than did Carex aquatilis, due to differences in size and structure of the two species. The composition of the plant community was a greater control on CH4 flux from the site than either water table height (which varied only slightly) or CH4 production rates, indicating the importance of species-specific plant dynamics in controlling CH4 flux from arctic wetlands.},

  abstract = {Understanding the genetic basis of traits involved in adaptive divergence and speciation is one of the most fundamental objectives in evolutionary biology. Toward that end, we look for signatures of extreme plate loss in the genome of freshwater threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Plateless stickleback have been found in only a few lakes and streams across the world; they represent the far extreme of a phenotypic continuum (plate number) that has been studied for years, although plateless individuals have not yet been the subject of much investigation. We use a dense single nucleotide polymorphism dataset made using RADseq to study fish from three freshwater populations containing plateless and low plated individuals, as well as fish from full plated marine populations. Analyses were performed using FastStructure, sliding windows F
ST, Bayescan and latent factor mixed models to search for genomic differences between the low plated and plateless phenotypes both within and among the three lakes. At least 18 genomic regions which may contribute to within-morph plate number variation were detected in our low plated stickleback populations. We see no evidence of a selective sweep between low and plateless fish; rather reduction of plate number within the low plated morph seems to be polygenic.},

  abstract = {Areas within an agricultural field in the same season often differ in crop productivity despite having the same cropping history, crop genotype, and management practices. One hypothesis is that abiotic or biotic factors in the soils differ between areas resulting in these productivity differences. In this study, bulk soil samples collected from a high and a low productivity area from within six agronomic fields in Illinois were quantified for abiotic and biotic characteristics. Extracted DNA from these bulk soil samples were shotgun sequenced. While logistic regression analyses resulted in no significant association between crop productivity and the 26 soil characteristics, principal coordinate analysis and constrained correspondence analysis showed crop productivity explained a major proportion of the taxa variance in the bulk soil microbiome. Metagenome-wide association studies (MWAS) identified more Bradyrhizodium and Gammaproteobacteria in higher productivity areas and more Actinobacteria, Ascomycota, Planctomycetales, and Streptophyta in lower productivity areas. Machine learning using a random forest method successfully predicted productivity based on the microbiome composition with the best accuracy of 0.79 at the order level. Our study showed that crop productivity differences were associated with bulk soil microbiome composition and highlighted several nitrogen utility-related taxa. We demonstrated the merit of MWAS and machine learning for the first time in a plant-microbiome study.},

Soil incubated in the laboratory at 60\% WFP supported maximum aerobic microbial activity as determined by CO2 production and O2 uptake. In the field, \% WFP of surface no-tillage soils (0-75 mm) at four U.S. locations averaged 62\% at time of sampling, whereas that for plowed soils was 44\%. This difference in \% WFP was reflected in 3.4 and 9.4 times greater CO2 and N2O production, respectively, from surface no-tillage soils over a 24-h period as compared to plowed soils. At a depth of 75 to 150 mm, \% WFP values increased in both no-tillage and plowed soils, averaging approximately 70\% for no tillage compared with 50 to 60\% for plowed soils. Production of CO2 in the plowed soils was enhanced by the increased \% WFP, resulting in little or no difference in CO2 production between tillage treatments. Nitrous oxide production, however, remained greater under no-tillage conditions. Substantially greater amounts of N2O were produced from the N-fertilized soils, regardless of tillage practice. Production of CO2 and N2O was primarily related to the \% WFP of tillage treatments although, in several instances, soil-water-soluble C and NOf levels were important as well. Calculations of relative aerobic microbial activity between no-tillage and plowed soils, based on differences in \% WFP relative to maximum activity at 60\%, indicated linear relationships for COj and NjO production between WFP values of 30 to 70\%. Below 60\% WFP, water limits microbial activity, but above 60\%, aerobic microbial activity decreases\textemdash{}apparently the result Of reduced aeration.},

  abstract = {Functional ecology aims at determining the relationships between species traits and environmental variables in order to better understand biological processes in ecosystems. From a methodological point of view, this biological objective calls for a method linking three data matrix tables: a table L with abundance or presence\textendash{}absence values for species at a series of sites, a table R with variables describing the environmental conditions of the sites, and a table Q containing traits (e.g., morphological or behavioral attributes) of the species. Ten years ago, the fourth-corner method was proposed to measure and test the relationships between species traits and environmental variables using tables R, L, and Q simultaneously. In practice, this method is rarely used. The major reasons for this lack of interest are the restriction of the original method and program to presence\textendash{}absence data in L and to the analysis of a single trait and a single environmental variable at a time. Moreover, ecologists often have problems in choosing a permutation model among the four originally proposed. In this paper, we revisit the fourth-corner method and propose improvements to the original approach. First, we present an extension to measure the link between species traits and environmental variables when the ecological community is described by abundance data. A new multivariate fourth-corner statistic is also proposed. Then, using numerical simulations, we discuss and evaluate the existing testing procedures. A new two-step testing procedure is presented. We hope that these elements will help ecologists use the best possible methodology to analyze this type of ecological problem.},

A simulation experiment is carried out to compare this technique with multiple regression (MR) and with a combination of principal component analysis and multiple regression (PCA+MR), varying the number of predictor variables and sample sizes. PLSR models explained a similar amount of variance to those results obtained by MR and PCA+MR. However, PLSR was more reliable than other techniques when identifying relevant variables and their magnitudes of influence, especially in cases of small sample size and low tolerance.

Empirical studies showing positive stability-diversity relationships have, for the most part, used a single class of stability (or, more accurately, instability) measures: the temporal variation in aggregate community properties such as biomass or productivity. We show that for these measures, stability will essentially always rise with species diversity because of the statistical averaging of the fluctuations in species' abundances. This simple probabilistic process will operate in the absence of any strong species interactions, although its strength is driven by the relative abundances of species, as well as by the existence of positive or negative correlations in the fluctuations of species. To explore the possible importance of this effect in real communities, we fit a simple simulation model to Tilman's grassland community. Our results indicate that statistical averaging might play a substantial role in explaining stability-diversity correlations for this and other systems. Models of statistical averaging can serve as a useful baseline for predictions of community stability, to which the influences of both negative and positive species interactions may then be added and tested.},

  abstract = {Aim Variation partitioning based on canonical analysis is the most commonly used analysis to investigate community patterns according to environmental and spatial predictors. Ecologists use this method in order to understand the pure contribution of the environment independent of space, and vice versa, as well as to control for inflated type I error in assessing the environmental component under spatial autocorrelation. Our goal is to use numerical simulations to compare how different spatial predictors and model selection procedures perform in assessing the importance of the spatial component and in controlling for type I error while testing environmental predictors. Innovation We determine for the first time how the ability of commonly used (polynomial regressors) and novel methods based on eigenvector maps compare in the realm of spatial variation partitioning. We introduce a novel forward selection procedure to select spatial regressors for community analysis. Finally, we point out a number of issues that have not been previously considered about the joint explained variation between environment and space, which should be taken into account when reporting and testing the unique contributions of environment and space in patterning ecological communities. Main conclusions In tests of species-environment relationships, spatial autocorrelation is known to inflate the level of type I error and make the tests of significance invalid. First, one must determine if the spatial component is significant using all spatial predictors (Moran's eigenvector maps). If it is, consider a model selection for the set of spatial predictors (an individual-species forward selection procedure is to be preferred) and use the environmental and selected spatial predictors in a partial regression or partial canonical analysis scheme. This is an effective way of controlling for type I error in such tests. Polynomial regressors do not provide tests with a correct level of type I error.},

  issn = {1600-0706},
  abstract = {There is increasing reliance on ecological models to improve our understanding of how ecological systems work, to project likely outcomes under alternative global change scenarios and to help develop robust management strategies. Two common types of spatiotemporally explicit ecological models are those focussed on biodiversity composition and those focussed on ecosystem function. These modelling disciplines are largely practiced separately, with separate literature, despite growing evidence that natural systems are shaped by the interaction of composition and function. Here we call for the development of new modelling approaches that integrate composition and function, accounting for the important interactions between these two dimensions, particularly under rapid global change. We examine existing modelling approaches that have begun to combine elements of composition and function, identifying their potential contribution to fully integrated modelling approaches. The development and application of integrated models of composition and function face a number of important challenges, including biological data limitations, system knowledge and computational constraints. We suggest a range of promising avenues that could help researchers overcome these challenges, including the use of virtual species, macroecological relationships and hybrid correlative-mechanistic modelling. Explicitly accounting for the interactions between composition and function within integrated modelling approaches has the potential to improve our understanding of ecological systems, provide more accurate predictions of their future states and transform their management. Synthesis There is increasing attention from researchers and policy makers around the world on both assessing and projecting the state of the planet's biodiversity, its ecosystems and the essential services they provide to society. However, existing modelling approaches largely ignore the interactions between biodiversity composition and ecosystem function. We highlight the key challenges and potential solutions to developing integrated models of composition and function. Such models will require a new effort and focus from ecologists, yet the benefits are likely to be substantial, including better informing the management of natural systems at regional, national and international scales.},

Recent research on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has contributed to this goal in several ways. By addressing a new question of high relevance for both science and society, by challenging existing paradigms, by tightly linking theory and experiments, by building scientific consensus beyond differences in opinion, by integrating fragmented disciplines and research fields, by connecting itself to other disciplines and management issues, it has helped transform ecology not only in content, but also in form. Creating a genuine evolutionary ecosystem ecology that links the evolution of species traits at the individual level, the dynamics of species interactions, and the overall functioning of ecosystems would give new impetus to this much-needed process of unification across ecological disciplines.

  shorttitle = {Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning},
  abstract = {The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has emerged as a major scientific issue today. As experiments progress, there is a growing need for adequate theories and models to provide robust interpretations and generalisations of experimental results, and to formulate new hypotheses. This paper provides an overview of recent theoretical advances that have been made on the two major questions in this area: (1) How does biodiversity affect the magnitude of ecosystem processes (short-term effects of biodiversity)? (2) How does biodiversity contribute to the stability and maintenance of ecosystem processes in the face of perturbations (long-term effects of biodiversity)? Positive short-term effects of species diversity on ecosystem processes, such as primary productivity and nutrient retention, have been explained by two major types of mechanisms: (1) functional niche complementarity (the complementarity effect), and (2) selection of extreme trait values (the selection effect). In both cases, biodiversity provides a range of phenotypic trait variation. In the complementarity effect, trait variation then forms the basis for a permanent association of species that enhances collective performance. In the selection effect, trait variation comes into play only as an initial condition, and a selective process then promotes dominance by species with extreme trait values. Major differences between within-site effects of biodiversity and across-site productivity\textendash{}diversity patterns have also been clarified. The local effects of diversity on ecosystem processes are expected to be masked by the effects of varying environmental parameters in across-site comparisons. A major reappraisal of the paradigm that has dominated during the last decades seems necessary if we are to account for long-term effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning. The classical deterministic, equilibrium approaches to stability do not explain the reduced temporal variability of aggregate ecosystem properties that has been observed in more diverse systems. On the other hand, stochastic, nonequilibrium approaches do show two types of biodiversity effects on ecosystem productivity in a fluctuating environment: (1) a buffering effect, i.e., a reduction in the temporal variance; and (2) a performance-enhancing effect, i.e., an increase in the temporal mean. The basic mechanisms involved in these long-term insurance effects are very similar to those that operate in short-term biodiversity effects: temporal niche complementarity, and selection of extreme trait values. The ability of species diversity to provide an insurance against environmental fluctuations and a reservoir of variation allowing adaptation to changing conditions may be critical in a long-term perspective. These recent theoretical developments in the area of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning suggest that linking community and ecosystem ecology is a fruitful avenue, which paves the way for a new ecological synthesis.},

However, recent research suggests that spatial processes influence both food web and ecosystem dynamics, and has led to the idea of {\^O}metaecosystems{\~O}. However, these processes have been tackled separately by {\^O}food web metacommunity{\~O} ecology, which focuses on the movement of traits, and {\^O}landscape ecosystem{\~O} ecology, which focuses on the movement of materials among ecosystems. Here, we argue that this conceptual gap must be bridged to fully understand ecosystem dynamics because many natural cases demonstrate the existence of interactions between the movements of traits and materials. This unification of concepts can be achieved under the metaecosystem framework, and we present two models that highlight how this framework yields novel insights. We then discuss patches, limiting factors and spatial explicitness as key issues to advance metaecosystem theory. We point out future avenues for research on metaecosystem theory and their potential for application to biological conservation.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been a considerable amount of research on the use of regularization methods for inference and prediction in quantitative genetics. Such research mostly focuses on selection of markers and shrinkage of their effects. In this review paper, the use of ridge regression for prediction in quantitative genetics using single-nucleotide polymorphism data is discussed. In particular, we consider (i) the theoretical foundations of ridge regression, (ii) its link to commonly used methods in animal breeding, (iii) the computational feasibility, and (iv) the scope for constructing prediction models with nonlinear effects (e.g., dominance and epistasis). Based on a simulation study we gauge the current and future potential of ridge regression for prediction of human traits using genome-wide SNP data. We conclude that, for outcomes with a relatively simple genetic architecture, given current sample sizes in most cohorts (i.e., ,000) the predictive accuracy of ridge regression is slightly higher than the classical genome-wide association study approach of repeated simple regression (i.e., one regression per SNP). However, both capture only a small proportion of the heritability. Nevertheless, we find evidence that for large-scale initiatives, such as biobanks, sample sizes can be achieved where ridge regression compared to the classical approach improves predictive accuracy substantially.},

Despite their growing application and importance, there are limited guidelines for performing PRS analyses, which can lead to inconsistency between studies and misinterpretation of results. Here we provide detailed guidelines for performing polygenic risk score analyses relevant to different methods for their calculation, outlining standard quality control steps and offering recommendations for best-practice. We also discuss different methods for the calculation of PRS, common misconceptions regarding the interpretation of results and future challenges.},

Allele frequency differences among ethnic groups and subgroups and admixture between different ethnic groups can result in frequent false-positive results or reduced power in genetic studies. Here, we review the problems and progress in defining population differences and the application of statistical methods to improve association studies. It is now possible to take into account the confounding effects of population stratification using thousands of unselected genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms or, alternatively, selected panels of ancestry informative markers. These methods do not require any demographic information and therefore can be widely applied to genotypes available from multiple sources. We further suggest that it will be important to explore results in homogeneous population subsets as we seek to define the extent to which genomic variation influences complex phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Bacteria comprise the most diverse domain of life on Earth, where they occupy nearly every possible ecological niche and play key roles in biological and chemical processes. Studying the composition and ecology of bacterial ecosystems and understanding their function are of prime importance. High-throughput sequencing technologies enable nearly comprehensive descriptions of bacterial diversity through 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons. Analyses of these communities generally rely upon taxonomic assignments through reference data bases or clustering approaches using de facto sequence similarity thresholds to identify operational taxonomic units. However, these methods often fail to resolve ecologically meaningful differences between closely related organisms in complex microbial data sets.
            
            
              In this paper, we describe oligotyping, a novel supervised computational method that allows researchers to investigate the diversity of closely related but distinct bacterial organisms in final operational taxonomic units identified in environmental data sets through 16S ribosomal RNA gene data by the canonical approaches.
            
            
              Our analysis of two data sets from two different environments demonstrates the capacity of oligotyping at discriminating distinct microbial populations of ecological importance.

  abstract = {Data from 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon sequencing present challenges to ecological and statistical interpretation. In particular, library sizes often vary over several ranges of magnitude, and the data contains many zeros. Although we are typically interested in comparing relative abundance of taxa in the ecosystem of two or more groups, we can only measure the taxon relative abundance in specimens obtained from the ecosystems. Because the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the specimen is not equivalent to the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the ecosystems, this presents a special challenge. Second, because the relative abundance of taxa in the specimen (as well as in the ecosystem) sum to 1, these are compositional data. Because the compositional data are constrained by the simplex (sum to 1) and are not unconstrained in the Euclidean space, many standard methods of analysis are not applicable. Here, we evaluate how these challenges impact the performance of existing normalization methods and differential abundance analyses.},

  abstract = {Extracellular enzymes represent a public good for microbial communities, as they break down complex molecules into simple molecules that microbes can take up. These communities are vulnerable to cheating by microbes that do not produce enzymes, but benefit from those produced by others. However, extracellular enzymes are ubiquitous and play an important role in the depolymerization of nutrients. We developed a multi-genotype, multi-nutrient model of a community of exoenzyme-producing microbes, in order to investigate the relationship between diversity, social interactions, and nutrient depolymerization. We focused on coalitions between complementary types of microbes and their implications for spatial pattern formation and nutrient depolymerization. The model included polymers containing carbon, nitrogen, or phosphorus, and eight genotypes of bacteria, which produced different subsets of the three enzymes responsible for hydrolyzing these polymers. We allowed social dynamics to emerge from a mechanistic model of enzyme production, action, and diffusion. We found that diversity was maximized at high rates of either diffusion or enzyme production (but not both). Conditions favoring cheating also favored the emergence of coalitions. We characterized the spatial patterns formed by different interactions, showing that same-type cooperation leads to aggregation, but between-type cooperation leads to an interwoven, filamentous pattern. Contrary to expectations based on niche complementarity, we found that nutrient depolymerization declined with increasing diversity due to a negative competitive effect of coalitions on generalist producers, leading to less overall enzyme production. This decline in depolymerization was stronger for non-limiting nutrients in the system. This study shows that social interactions among microbes foraging for complementary resources can influence microbial diversity, microbial spatial distributions, and rates of nutrient depolymerization.},

We used species-level abundance data from 62 plant communities across five continents to assess mechanisms of temporal stability across spatial scales. We assessed how asynchrony (i.e. different units responding dissimilarly through time) of species and local communities stabilised metacommunity ecosystem function. Asynchrony of species increased stability of local communities, and asynchrony among local communities enhanced metacommunity stability by a wide range of magnitudes (1\textendash{}315\%); this range was positively correlated with the size of the metacommunity. Additionally, asynchronous responses among local communities were linked with species' populations fluctuating asynchronously across space, perhaps stemming from physical and/or competitive differences among local communities. Accordingly, we suggest spatial heterogeneity should be a major focus for maintaining the stability of ecosystem services at larger spatial scales.},

The focus of the field is now shifting to identifying the mechanisms that shape these patterns. Here, we propose that four processes \textemdash{} selection, drift, dispersal and mutation \textemdash{} create and maintain microbial biogeographic patterns on inseparable ecological and evolutionary scales. We consider how the interplay of these processes affects one biogeographic pattern, the distance\textendash{}decay relationship, and review evidence from the published literature for the processes driving this pattern in microorganisms. Given the limitations of inferring processes from biogeographic patterns, we suggest that studies should focus on directly testing the underlying processes.},

  shorttitle = {The Unseen Majority},
  abstract = {Microbes are the unseen majority in soil and comprise a large portion of life{\~O}s genetic diversity. Despite their abundance, the impact of soil microbes on ecosystem processes is still poorly understood. Here we explore the various roles that soil microbes play in terrestrial ecosystems with special emphasis on their contribution to plant productivity and diversity. Soil microbes are important regulators of plant productivity, especially in nutrient poor ecosystems where plant symbionts are responsible for the acquisition of limiting nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogenfixing bacteria are responsible for c. 5\textendash{}20\% (grassland and savannah) to 80\% (temperate and boreal forests) of all nitrogen, and up to 75\% of phosphorus, that is acquired by plants annually. Free-living microbes also strongly regulate plant productivity, through the mineralization of, and competition for, nutrients that sustain plant productivity. Soil microbes, including microbial pathogens, are also important regulators of plant community dynamics and plant diversity, determining plant abundance and, in some cases, facilitating invasion by exotic plants. Conservative estimates suggest that c. 20 000 plant species are completely dependent on microbial symbionts for growth and survival pointing to the importance of soil microbes as regulators of plant species richness on Earth. Overall, this review shows that soil microbes must be considered as important drivers of plant diversity and productivity in terrestrial ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The transcription dynamics of subunit A of the key gene in methanogenesis (methyl coenzyme M reductase; mcrA) was studied to evaluate the relationship between process rate (methanogenesis) and gene transcription dynamics in a peat soil ecosystem. Soil methanogen process rates were determined during incubation of peat slurries at temperatures from 4 to 37\textdegree{}C, and real-time quantitative PCR was applied to quantify the abundances of mcrA genes and transcripts; corresponding transcriptional dynamics were calculated from mcrA transcript/gene ratios. Internal standards suggested unbiased recovery of mRNA abundances in comparison to DNA levels. In comparison to those in pure-culture studies, mcrA transcript/gene ratios indicated underestimation by 1 order of magnitude, possibly due to high proportions of inactive or dead methanogens. Methane production rates were temperature dependent, with maxima at 25\textdegree{}C, but changes in abundance and transcription of the mcrA gene showed no correlation with temperature. However, mcrA transcript/gene ratios correlated weakly (regression coefficient = 0.76) with rates of methanogenesis. Methanogen process rates increased over 3 orders of magnitude, while the corresponding maximum transcript/gene ratio increase was only 18-fold. mcrA transcript dynamics suggested steady-state expression in peat soil after incubation for 24 and 48 h, similar to that in stationary-phase cultures. mcrA transcript/gene ratios are therefore potential in situ indicators of methanogen process rate changes in complex soil systems.},

  issn = {1092-2172, 1098-5557},
  abstract = {Ammonia oxidizers (family Nitrobacteraceae) and methanotrophs (family Methylococcaceae) oxidize CO and CH4 to CO2 and NH4+ to NO2-. However, the relative contributions of the two groups of organisms to the metabolism of CO, CH4, and NH4+ in various environments are not known. In the ammonia oxidizers, ammonia monooxygenase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of NH4+ to NH2OH, also catalyzes the oxidation of CH4 to CH3OH. Ammonia monooxygenase also mediates the transformation of CH3OH to CO2 and cell carbon, but the pathway by which this is done is not known. At least one species of ammonia oxidizer, Nitrosococcus oceanus, exhibits a Km for CH4 oxidation similar to that of methanotrophs. However, the highest rate of CH4 oxidation recorded in an ammonia oxidizer is still five times lower than rates in methanotrophs, and ammonia oxidizers are apparently unable to grow on CH4. Methanotrophs oxidize NH4+ to NH2OH via methane monooxygenase and NH4+ to NH2OH via methane monooxygenase and NH2OH to NO2- via an NH2OH oxidase which may resemble the enzyme found in ammonia oxidizers. Maximum rates of NH4+ oxidation are considerably lower than in ammonia oxidizers, and the affinity for NH4+ is generally lower than in ammonia oxidizers. NH4+ does not apparently support growth in methanotrophs. Both ammonia monooxygenase and methane monooxygenase oxidize CO to CO2, but CO cannot support growth in either ammonia oxidizers or methanotrophs. These organisms have affinities for CO which are comparable to those for their growth substrates and often higher than those in carboxydobacteria. The methane monooxygenases of methanotrophs exist in two forms: a soluble form and a particulate form. The soluble form is well characterized and appears unrelated to the particulate. Ammonia monooxygenase and the particulate methane monooxygenase share a number of similarities. Both enzymes contain copper and are membrane bound. They oxidize a variety of inorganic and organic compounds, and their inhibitor profiles are similar. Inhibitors thought to be specific to ammonia oxidizers have been used in environmental studies of nitrification. However, almost all of the numerous compounds found to inhibit ammonia oxidizers also inhibit methanotrophs, and most of the inhibitors act upon the monooxygenases. Many probably exert their effect by chelating copper, which is essential to the proper functioning of some monooxygenases. The lack of inhibitors specific for one or the other of the two groups of bacteria hampers the determination of their relative roles in nature.},

  abstract = {Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a result of complex gene\textendash{}environment interactions, and several risk factors have been identified, including age, family history, diet, sedentary lifestyle and obesity. Statistical models that combine known risk factors for T2D can partly identify individuals at high risk of developing the disease. However, these studies have so far indicated that human genetics contributes little to the models, whereas socio-demographic and environmental factors have greater influence1. Recent evidence suggests the importance of the gut microbiota as an environmental factor, and an altered gut microbiota has been linked to metabolic diseases including obesity2,3, diabetes4 and cardiovascular disease5. Here we use shotgun sequencing to characterize the faecal metagenome of 145 European women with normal, impaired or diabetic glucose control. We observe compositional and functional alterations in the metagenomes of women with T2D, and develop a mathematical model based on metagenomic profiles that identified T2D with high accuracy. We applied this model to women with impaired glucose tolerance, and show that it can identify women who have a diabetes-like metabolism. Furthermore, glucose control and medication were unlikely to have major confounding effects. We also applied our model to a recently described Chinese cohort4 and show that the discriminant metagenomic markers for T2D differ between the European and Chinese cohorts. Therefore, metagenomic predictive tools for T2D should be specific for the age and geographical location of the populations studied.},

Whereas we typically control the type I error rate for a single-hypothesis test, a compound error rate is controlled for multiple-hypothesis tests.

Whereas a sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite approach\textemdash{}we fix the rejection region and then estimate its corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased applicability, accuracy and power. We apply the methodology to both the positive false discovery rate pFDR and FDR, and provide evidence for its benefits. It is shown that pFDR is probably the quantity of interest over FDR. Also discussed is the calculation of the q-value, the pFDR analogue of the p-value, which eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over eight times in power compared with the Benjamini\textendash{}Hochberg FDR method.},

This gene encodes the {$\alpha$} subunit of the methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR), which catalyzes the last step in methanogenesis and is present in all methanogens. Cultivation-independent analysis of methanogenic communities involves the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the mcrA gene from extracted community DNA, comparative analysis of mcrA clone libraries, or PCR-based fingerprinting analysis by terminal restriction fragment polymorphism analysis (T-RFLP). It has also been suggested that anaerobic methane-oxidizing Archaea possess MCR, which facilitates detection of this novel group of ``reverse methanogens'' as well using the mcrA gene as a functional marker.},

Here we characterize genetic variation in a sample of 3,000 European individuals genotyped at over half a million variable DNA sites in the human genome.

The results emphasize that when mapping the genetic basis of a disease phenotype, spurious associations can arise if genetic structure is not properly accounted for.

  abstract = {We present a method for selecting entire microbial ecosystems for bioremediation and other practical purposes. A population of ecosystems is established in the laboratory, each ecosystem is measured for a desired property (in our case, degradation of the environmental pollutant 3-chloroaniline), and the best ecosystems are used as `parents' to inoculate a new generation of `offspring' ecosystems. Over many generations of variation and selection, the ecosystems become increasingly well adapted to produce the desired property. The procedure is similar to standard artificial selection experiments except that whole ecosystems, rather than single individuals, are the units of selection. The procedure can also be understood in terms of complex system theory as a way of searching a vast combinatorial space (many thousands of microbial species and many thousands of genes within species) for combinations that are especially good at producing the desired property. Ecosystem-level selection can be performed without any specific knowledge of the species that comprise the ecosystems and can select ensembles of species that would be difficult to discover with more reductionistic methods. Once a `designer ecosystem' has been created by ecosystem-level selection, reductionistic methods can be used to identify the component species and to discover how they interact to produce the desired effect.},

  abstract = {Artificial selection has been practiced by humans since the dawn of agriculture, but only recently have evolutionary ecologists turned to this tool to understand nature. To perform artificial selection, the phenotypic trait of interest is measured on a population, and the individuals with the most extreme phenotypic values are bred to produce the next generation. The change in the mean of the selected trait across each generation is the response to selection, and other traits can also evolve due to genetic correlations with the selected trait. Artificial selection can directly answer the question of how quickly a trait will evolve under a given strength of selection. This kind of result can help ecologists determine whether range or niche boundaries are determined by a lack of variation for a key phenotypic trait or trade-offs due to genetic correlations with other fitness-related traits. In a related approach, controlled natural selection, the organisms are not selected according to their values for a given trait, but rather are allowed to evolve for one to several generations under experimentally imposed environmental treatments such as temperature, light, nutrients, presence or absence of predators or competitors, etc. The results of this kind of study can tell us how quickly a population can adapt to a given environmental change, either natural or anthropogenic. Finally, artificial selection can create more variation for measurements of natural selection or can be coupled with QTL mapping; both these combinations provide new insights into adaptation. I discuss advantages and disadvantages of these approaches relative to other kinds of studies and highlight case studies showing how these tools can answer a wide range of basic and applied questions in ecology, ranging from niche and range boundaries and character displacement to climate change and invasive species.},

  volume = {8},
  issn = {1866-3508},
  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The global methane (CH\textsubscript{4}) budget is becoming an increasingly important component for managing realistic pathways to mitigate climate change. This relevance, due to a shorter atmospheric lifetime and a stronger warming potential than carbon dioxide, is challenged by the still unexplained changes of atmospheric CH\textsubscript{4} over the past decade. Emissions and concentrations of CH\textsubscript{4} are continuing to increase, making CH\textsubscript{4} the second most important human-induced greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Two major difficulties in reducing uncertainties come from the large variety of diffusive CH\textsubscript{4} sources that overlap geographically, and from the destruction of CH\textsubscript{4} by the very short-lived hydroxyl radical (OH). To address these difficulties, we have established a consortium of multi-disciplinary scientists under the umbrella of the Global Carbon Project to synthesize and stimulate research on the methane cycle, and producing regular ({$\sim$} biennial) updates of the global methane budget. This consortium includes atmospheric physicists and chemists, biogeochemists of surface and marine emissions, and socio-economists who study anthropogenic emissions. Following Kirschke et al. (2013), we propose here the first version of a living review paper that integrates results of top-down studies (exploiting atmospheric observations within an atmospheric inverse-modelling framework) and bottom-up models, inventories and data-driven approaches (including process-based models for estimating land surface emissions and atmospheric chemistry, and inventories for anthropogenic emissions, data-driven extrapolations). {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} For the 2003\textendash{}2012 decade, global methane emissions are estimated by top-down inversions at 558TgCH\textsubscript{4}yr\textsuperscript{-1}, range 540\textendash{}568. About 60\% of global emissions are anthropogenic (range 50\textendash{}65\%). Since 2010, the bottom-up global emission inventories have been closer to methane emissions in the most carbon-intensive Representative Concentrations Pathway (RCP8.5) and higher than all other RCP scenarios. Bottom-up approaches suggest larger global emissions (736TgCH\textsubscript{4}yr\textsuperscript{-1}, range 596\textendash{}884) mostly because of larger natural emissions from individual sources such as inland waters, natural wetlands and geological sources. Considering the atmospheric constraints on the top-down budget, it is likely that some of the individual emissions reported by the bottom-up approaches are overestimated, leading to too large global emissions. Latitudinal data from top-down emissions indicate a predominance of tropical emissions ({$\sim$} 64\% of the global budget, \&lt;30\textdegree{}N) as compared to mid ({$\sim$}32\%, 30\textendash{}60\textdegree{}N) and high northern latitudes ({$\sim$} 4\%, 60\textendash{}90\textdegree{}N). Top-down inversions consistently infer lower emissions in China ({$\sim$} 58TgCH\textsubscript{4}yr\textsuperscript{-1}, range 51\textendash{}72, -14\%) and higher emissions in Africa (86TgCH\textsubscript{4}yr\textsuperscript{-1}, range 73\textendash{}108, +19\%) than bottom-up values used as prior estimates. Overall, uncertainties for anthropogenic emissions appear smaller than those from natural sources, and the uncertainties on source categories appear larger for top-down inversions than for bottom-up inventories and models. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} The most important source of uncertainty on the methane budget is attributable to emissions from wetland and other inland waters. We show that the wetland extent could contribute 30\textendash{}40\% on the estimated range for wetland emissions. Other priorities for improving the methane budget include the following: (i) the development of process-based models for inland-water emissions, (ii) the intensification of methane observations at local scale (flux measurements) to constrain bottom-up land surface models, and at regional scale (surface networks and satellites) to constrain top-down inversions, (iii) improvements in the estimation of atmospheric loss by OH, and (iv) improvements of the transport models integrated in top-down inversions.

  abstract = {Getting a rise out of agriculture
Methane, a powerful and important greenhouse gas, has been accumulating nearly uninterruptedly in the atmosphere for the past 200 years, with the exception of a mysterious plateau between 1999 and 2006. Schaefer et al. measured methane's carbon isotopic composition in samples collected over the past 35 years in order to constrain the cause of the pause. Lower thermogenic emissions or variations in the hydroxyldriven methane sink caused the plateau. Thermogenic emissions didn't resume to cause the subsequent rise. Instead, the ongoing rise is most likely due to biogenic sources, most notably agriculture.
Science, this issue p. 80
Between 1999 and 2006, a plateau interrupted the otherwise continuous increase of atmospheric methane concentration [CH4] since preindustrial times. Causes could be sink variability or a temporary reduction in industrial or climate-sensitive sources. We reconstructed the global history of [CH4] and its stable carbon isotopes from ice cores, archived air, and a global network of monitoring stations. A box-model analysis suggests that diminishing thermogenic emissions, probably from the fossil-fuel industry, and/or variations in the hydroxyl CH4 sink caused the [CH4] plateau. Thermogenic emissions did not resume to cause the renewed [CH4] rise after 2006, which contradicts emission inventories. Post-2006 source increases are predominantly biogenic, outside the Arctic, and arguably more consistent with agriculture than wetlands. If so, mitigating CH4 emissions must be balanced with the need for food production.
The atmospheric methane level has resumed its increase after a plateau between 1999 and 2006.

  abstract = {Genes of archaea encoding homologues of ammonia monooxygenases have been found on a widespread basis and in large amounts in almost all terrestrial and marine environments, indicating that ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) might play a major role in nitrification on Earth. However, only one pure isolate of this group from a marine environment has so far been obtained, demonstrating archaeal ammonia oxidation coupled with autotrophic growth similar to the bacterial counterparts. Here we describe the cultivation and isolation of an AOA from soil. It grows on ammonia or urea as an energy source and is capable of using higher ammonia concentrations than the marine isolate, Nitrosopumilus maritimus. Surprisingly, although it is able to grow chemolithoautotrophically, considerable growth rates of this strain are obtained only upon addition of low amounts of pyruvate or when grown in coculture with bacteria. Our findings expand the recognized metabolic spectrum of AOA and help explain controversial results obtained in the past on the activity and carbon assimilation of these globally distributed organisms.},

Studies to date have been correlational because of the difficulty in cultivating their constituent species in pure culture. Here, we investigate the causal link between methanogenesis and diversity in laboratory anaerobic digesters by experimentally manipulating the diversity of cultures by dilution and subsequent equilibration of biomass. This process necessarily leads to the loss of the rarer species from communities. We find a positive relationship between methane production and the number of taxa, with little evidence of functional saturation, suggesting that rare species play an important role in methane-\-producing communities. No correlations were found between the initial composition and methane production across natural communities, but a positive relationship between species richness and methane production emerged following ecological selection imposed by the laboratory conditions. Our data suggest methanogenic communities show little functional redundancy, and hence, any loss of diversity\textemdash{}both natural and resulting from changes in propagation conditions during anaerobic digestion\textemdash{}is likely to reduce methane production.},

Researchers applying these methods assume that the signs and magnitudes of species interactions and vital rates can be reliably parsed from observational data on species9 (relative) abundances. However, we contend that this assumption is violated when sample units contain any underlying spatial structure. Here, we show how three phenomena - Simpson9s paradox, context-dependence, and nonlinear averaging - can lead to erroneous conclusions about population parameters and species interactions when samples contain heterogeneous mixtures of populations or communities. At the root of this issue is the fundamental mismatch between the spatial scales of species interactions (micrometres) and those of typical microbial community samples (millimetres to centimetres). These issues can be overcome by measuring and accounting for spatial heterogeneity at very small scales, which will lead to more reliable inference of the ecological mechanisms structuring natural microbial communities.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Belowground organisms play critical roles in maintaining multiple ecosystem processes, including plant productivity, decomposition, and nutrient cycling. Despite their importance, however, we have a limited understanding of how and why belowground biodiversity (bacteria, fungi, protists, and invertebrates) may change as soils develop over centuries to millennia (pedogenesis). Moreover, it is unclear whether belowground biodiversity changes during pedogenesis are similar to the patterns observed for aboveground plant diversity. Here we evaluated the roles of resource availability, nutrient stoichiometry, and soil abiotic factors in driving belowground biodiversity across 16 soil chronosequences (from centuries to millennia) spanning a wide range of globally distributed ecosystem types. Changes in belowground biodiversity during pedogenesis followed two main patterns. In lower-productivity ecosystems (i.e., drier and colder), increases in belowground biodiversity tracked increases in plant cover. In more productive ecosystems (i.e., wetter and warmer), increased acidification during pedogenesis was associated with declines in belowground biodiversity. Changes in the diversity of bacteria, fungi, protists, and invertebrates with pedogenesis were strongly and positively correlated worldwide, highlighting that belowground biodiversity shares similar ecological drivers as soils and ecosystems develop. In general, temporal changes in aboveground plant diversity and belowground biodiversity were not correlated, challenging the common perception that belowground biodiversity should follow similar patterns to those of plant diversity during ecosystem development. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that ecological patterns in belowground biodiversity are predictable across major globally distributed ecosystem types and suggest that shifts in plant cover and soil acidification during ecosystem development are associated with changes in belowground biodiversity over centuries to millennia.},

Although stochastic processes are believed to play nonnegligible roles in shaping community structure, their importance relative to deterministic processes is hotly debated. The importance of ecological stochasticity in shaping microbial community structure is far less appreciated. Some of the main reasons for such heavy debates are the difficulty in defining stochasticity and the diverse methods used for delineating stochasticity. Here, we provide a critical review and synthesis of data from the most recent studies on stochastic community assembly in microbial ecology. We then describe both stochastic and deterministic components embedded in various ecological processes, including selection, dispersal, diversification, and drift. We also describe different approaches for inferring stochasticity from observational diversity patterns and highlight experimental approaches for delineating ecological stochasticity in microbial communities. In addition, we highlight research challenges, gaps, and future directions for microbial community assembly research.},

  abstract = {Stochasticity emerging from random differences in replication, death, mutation, and dispersal is thought to alter the composition of ecological communities. However, the importance of stochastic effects remains somewhat speculative because stochasticity is not directly measured but is instead inferred from unexplained variations in beta-diversity. Here, we performed a field experiment to more directly disentangle the role of stochastic processes, environmental selection, and dispersal in the composition and functioning of a natural bacterial decomposer community in the field. To increase our ability to detect these effects, we reduced initial biological and environmental heterogeneity using replicate nylon litterbags in the field. We then applied two treatments: ambient/added precipitation and bacterial and fungal dispersal using ``open'' litterbags (made from 18.0-{$\mu$}m-pore-size mesh) (``open bacterial dispersal'') versus bacterial and fungal dispersal using ``closed'' litterbags (made from 22.0-{$\mu$}m-pore-size mesh) (``closed bacterial dispersal''). After 5 months, we assayed composition and functioning by the use of three subsamples from each litterbag to disentangle stochastic effects from residual variation. Our results indicate that stochasticity via ecological drift can contribute to beta-diversity in bacterial communities. However, residual variation, which had previously been included in stochasticity estimates, accounted for more than four times as much variability. At the same time, stochastic effects on beta-diversity were not attenuated at the functional level, as measured by genetic functional potential and extracellular enzyme activity. Finally, dispersal was found to interact with precipitation availability to influence the degree to which stochasticity contributed to functional variation. Together, our results demonstrate that the ability to quantify stochastic processes is key to understanding microbial diversity and its role in ecosystem functioning.
IMPORTANCE Randomness can alter the diversity and composition of ecological communities. Such stochasticity may therefore obscure the relationship between the environment and community composition and hinder our ability to predict the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. This study investigated the role of stochastic processes, environmental selection, and dispersal in microbial composition and its functioning on an intact field community. To do this, we used a controlled and replicated experiment that was similar to that used to study population genetics in the laboratory. Our study showed that, while the stochastic effects on taxonomic composition are smaller than expected, the degree to which stochasticity contributes to variability in ecosystem processes may be much higher than previously assumed.},

While non-manipulative data allow for only correlative and not causal inference, this framework facilitates the formulation of data-driven hypotheses regarding the processes that structure communities. We model environmental filtering by variation and covariation in the responses of individual species to the characteristics of their environment, with potential contingencies on species traits and phylogenetic relationships. We capture biotic assembly rules by species-to-species association matrices, which may be estimated at multiple spatial or temporal scales. We operationalise the HMSC framework as a hierarchical Bayesian joint species distribution model, and implement it as R- and Matlab-packages which enable computationally efficient analyses of large data sets. Armed with this tool, community ecologists can make sense of many types of data, including spatially explicit data and time-series data. We illustrate the use of this framework through a series of diverse ecological examples.},

The approach does not assume a particular experimental design or require monoculture data, making it more general than previous approaches. Using the Price Equation from evolutionary biology, I show that three distinct effects cause ecosystem function to vary between sites: the ``species richness effect'' (SRE; random loss of species richness), the ``species composition effect'' (SCE; nonrandom loss of high- or low-functioning species), and the ``context dependence effect'' (CDE; post-loss changes in the functioning of the remaining species). The SRE reduces ecosystem function without altering mean function per species. The SCE is analogous to natural selection in evolution. Nonrandom loss of, for example, high-functioning species will reduce mean function per species, and thus total function, just as selection against large individuals in an evolving population reduces mean body size in the next generation. The CDE is analogous to imperfect transmission in evolution. For instance, any factor (e.g., an environmental change) causing offspring to attain smaller body sizes than their parents (imperfect transmission) will reduce the mean body size in the next generation. Analogously, any factor causing the species remaining at the post-loss site to make smaller functional contributions than at the pre-loss site will reduce mean function per species, and thus total function. I use published data to illustrate how this new partition generalizes previous approaches, facilitates comparative analyses, and generates new empirical insights. In particular, the SCE often is less important than other effects.},

  abstract = {The metacommunity concept is an important way to think about linkages between different spatial scales in ecology. Here we review current understanding about this concept. We first investigate issues related to its definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

  abstract = {Recent work linking community structure and ecosystem function has primarily focused on the effects of local species richness but has neglected the dispersal-dependent processes of community assembly that are ultimately involved in determining community structure and its relation to ecosystems. Here we combine simple consumer-resource competition models and metacommunity theory with discussion of case studies to outline how spatial processes within metacommunities can alter community assembly and modify expectations about how species diversity and composition influence ecosystem attributes at local scales. We argue that when community assembly is strongly limited by dispersal, this can constrain ecosystem functioning by reducing positive selection effects (reducing the probability of the most productive species becoming dominant) even though it may often also enhance complementarity (favoring combinations of species that enhance production even though they may not individually be most productive). Conversely, excess dispersal with strong source-sink relations among heterogeneous habitats can reduce ecosystem functioning by swamping local filters that would normally favor better-suited species. Ecosystem function is thus most likely maximized at intermediate levels of dispersal where both of these effects are minimized. In this scenario, we find that the selection effect is maximized, while complementarity is often reduced and local diversity may often be relatively low. Our synthesis emphasizes that it is the entire set of community assembly processes that affect the functioning of ecosystems, not just the part that determines local species richness.},

  abstract = {The continuous increase of nitrous oxide (N2O) abundance in the atmosphere is a global concern. Multiple pathways of N2O production occur in soil, but their significance and dependence on oxygen (O2) availability and nitrogen (N) fertilizer source are poorly understood. We examined N2O and nitric oxide (NO) production under 21\%, 3\%, 1\%, 0.5\%, and 0\% (vol/vol) O2 concentrations following urea or ammonium sulfate [(NH4)2SO4] additions in loam, clay loam, and sandy loam soils that also contained ample nitrate. The contribution of the ammonia (NH3) oxidation pathways (nitrifier nitrification, nitrifier denitrification, and nitrification-coupled denitrification) and heterotrophic denitrification (HD) to N2O production was determined in 36-h incubations in microcosms by 15N-18O isotope and NH3 oxidation inhibition (by 0.01\% acetylene) methods. Nitrous oxide and NO production via NH3 oxidation pathways increased as O2 concentrations decreased from 21\% to 0.5\%. At low (0.5\% and 3\%) O2 concentrations, nitrifier denitrification contributed between 34\% and 66\%, and HD between 34\% and 50\% of total N2O production. Heterotrophic denitrification was responsible for all N2O production at 0\% O2. Nitrifier denitrification was the main source of N2O production from ammonical fertilizer under low O2 concentrations with urea producing more N2O than (NH4)2SO4 additions. These findings challenge established thought attributing N2O emissions from soils with high water content to HD due to presumably low O2 availability. Our results imply that management practices that increase soil aeration, e.g., reducing compaction and enhancing soil structure, together with careful selection of fertilizer sources and/or nitrification inhibitors, could decrease N2O production in agricultural soils.},

In recent years, identification of the microbial assemblages responsible for soil N2O production has substantially advanced with the development of molecular technologies and the discoveries of novel functional guilds and new types of metabolism. However, few practical tools are available to effectively reduce in situ soil N2O flux. Combating the negative impacts of increasing N2O fluxes poses considerable challenges and will be ineffective without successfully incorporating microbially regulated N2O processes into ecosystem modeling and mitigation strategies. Here, we synthesize the latest knowledge of (i) the key microbial pathways regulating N2O production and consumption processes in terrestrial ecosystems and the critical environmental factors influencing their occurrence, and (ii) the relative contributions of major biological pathways to soil N2O emissions by analyzing available natural isotopic signatures of N2O and by using stable isotope enrichment and inhibition techniques. We argue that it is urgently necessary to incorporate microbial traits into biogeochemical ecosystem modeling in order to increase the estimation reliability of N2O emissions. We further propose a molecular methodology oriented framework from gene to ecosystem scales for more robust prediction and mitigation of future N2O emissions.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference is an important statistical tool that is increasingly being used by ecologists. In a Bayesian analysis, information available before a study is conducted is summarized in a quantitative model or hypothesis: the prior probability distribution. Bayes{\~O} Theorem uses the prior probability distribution and the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution. Posterior probability distributions are an epistemological alternative to P-values and provide a direct measure of the degree of belief that can be placed on models, hypotheses, or parameter estimates. Moreover, Bayesian information-theoretic methods provide robust measures of the probability of alternative models, and multiple models can be averaged into a single model that reflects uncertainty in model construction and selection. These methods are demonstrated through a simple worked example. Ecologists are using Bayesian inference in studies that range from predicting single-species population dynamics to understanding ecosystem processes. Not all ecologists, however, appreciate the philosophical underpinnings of Bayesian inference. In particular, Bayesians and frequentists differ in their definition of probability and in their treatment of model parameters as random variables or estimates of true values. These assumptions must be addressed explicitly before deciding whether or not to use Bayesian methods to analyse ecological data.},

  abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

  issn = {2150-8925},
  abstract = {{$\beta$}-diversity represents the compositional variation among communities from site-to-site, linking local ({$\alpha$}-diversity) and regional ({$\gamma$}-diversity). Researchers often desire to compare values of {$\beta$}-diversity across localities or experimental treatments, and to use this comparison to infer possible mechanisms of community assembly. However, the majority of metrics used to estimate {$\beta$}-diversity, including most dissimilarity metrics (e.g., Jaccard's and S{\o}renson's dissimilarity index), can vary simply because of changes in the other two diversity components ({$\alpha$} or {$\gamma$}-diversity). Here, we overview the utility of taking a null model approach that allows one to discern whether variation in the measured dissimilarity among communities results more from changes in the underlying structure by which communities vary, or instead simply due to difference in {$\alpha$}-diversity among localities or experimental treatments. We illustrate one particular approach, originally developed by Raup and Crick (1979) in the paleontological literature, which creates a re-scaled probability metric ranging from -1 to 1, indicating whether local communities are more dissimilar (approaching 1), as dissimilar (approaching 0), or less dissimilar (approaching -1), than expected by random chance. The value of this metric provides some indication of the possible underlying mechanisms of community assembly, in particular the degree to which deterministic processes create communities that deviate from those based on stochastic (null) expectations. We demonstrate the utility of this metric when compared to analyses of Jaccard's dissimilarity index with case studies from disparate empirical systems (coral reefs and freshwater ponds) that differ in the degree to which disturbance altered {$\alpha$}-diversity, as well as the selectivity by which disturbance acted on members of the community.},

  abstract = {Ecological community assembly is governed by a combination of (i) selection resulting from among-taxa differences in performance; (ii) dispersal resulting from organismal movement; and (iii) ecological drift resulting from stochastic changes in population sizes. The relative importance and nature of these processes can vary across environments. Selection can be homogeneous or variable, and while dispersal is a rate, we conceptualize extreme dispersal rates as two categories; dispersal limitation results from limited exchange of organisms among communities, and homogenizing dispersal results from high levels of organism exchange. To estimate the influence and spatial variation of each process we extend a recently developed statistical framework, use a simulation model to evaluate the accuracy of the extended framework, and use the framework to examine subsurface microbial communities over two geologic formations. For each subsurface community we estimate the degree to which it is influenced by homogeneous selection, variable selection, dispersal limitation, and homogenizing dispersal. Our analyses revealed that the relative influences of these ecological processes vary substantially across communities even within a geologic formation. We further identify environmental and spatial features associated with each ecological process, which allowed mapping of spatial variation in ecological-process-influences. The resulting maps provide a new lens through which ecological systems can be understood; in the subsurface system investigated here they revealed that the influence of variable selection was associated with the rate at which redox conditions change with subsurface depth.},

  volume = {54},
  issn = {00380717},
  abstract = {Methane (CH4) production varies greatly among different types of peatlands along an ombrotrophice minerotrophic hydrogeomorphic gradient. pH is thought to be a dominant control over observed differences in CH4 production across sites, and previous pH manipulation experiments have verified the inhibitory effect of low pH on CH4 production. In this experiment, we asked (i) if the major effect of low pH is direct inhibition of one or both pathways of methanogenesis and/or inhibition of `upstream' fermentation that provides substrates for methanogens, and (ii) to what extent is pH sufficient to explain differences in CH4 production relative to other factors that co-vary across the gradient. To address these questions, we adjusted the pH of peat slurries from 6 peatlands to 4 levels (3.5, 4.5, 5.5, and 6.5) that reflected their range of native pH, maintained these pH levels over a 43-day anaerobic laboratory incubation, and measured a suite of responses within the anaerobic carbon cycle. Higher pH caused a significant increase in CO2 production in all sites. Regardless of site, time, and pH level, the reduction of inorganic electron acceptors contributed to {$<$}12\% of total CO2 production. Higher pH caused acetate pooling by Day 7, but this effect was greater in the more ombrotrophic sites and lasted throughout the incubation, whereas acetate was almost completely consumed as a substrate for acetoclastic methanogenesis by Day 43 in the minerotrophic sites. Higher pH also enhanced CH4 production and this process was up to 436\% more sensitive to changes in pH than CO2 production. However, across all sites and pH levels, CH4 production accounted for {$<$}25\% of the total gaseous C production. Fermentation appeared to be the main pathway for anaerobic C mineralization. Our results indicate that low pH inhibits CH4 production through direct inhibition of both methanogenesis pathways and indirectly through its effects on fermentation, but the direct effects are stronger. The inability of acetoclastic methanogenesis to fully compensate for acetate pooling in ombrotrophic peats at higher pH suggests that CH4 production is inhibited by some factor(s) in addition to pH in these sites. We examine a variety of other potential inhibitory mechanisms and postulate that humic substances may provide an important inhibitory effect over CH4 production in ombrotrophic peatlands.},

  abstract = {Predicting host health status based on microbial community structure is a major goal of microbiome research. An implicit assumption of microbiome profiling for diagnostic purposes is that the proportional representation of different taxa determine host phenotypes. To test this assumption, we colonized gnotobiotic zebrafish with zebrafish-derived bacterial isolates and measured bacterial abundance and host neutrophil responses. Surprisingly, combinations of bacteria elicited immune responses that do not reflect the numerically dominant species. These data are consistent with a quantitative model in which the host responses to commensal species are additive, but where various species have different per capita immunostimulatory effects. For example, one species has a high per capita immunosuppression that is mediated through a potent secreted factor. We conclude that the proportional representation of bacteria in a community does not necessarily predict its functional capacities; however, characterizing specific properties of individual species offers predictive insights into multi-species community function.},

To directly measure functional roles of uncultivated microbes, we developed Chip-stable isotope probing (SIP), a high-sensitivity, high-throughput SIP method performed on a phylogenetic microarray (chip).

Laboratory experiments demonstrated that Chip-SIP can detect isotopic enrichment of 0.5 atom \% 13C and 0.1 atom \% 15N, thus permitting experiments with short incubation times and low substrate concentrations. We applied Chip-SIP analysis to a natural estuarine community and quantified amino acid, nucleic acid or fatty acid incorporation by 81 distinct microbial taxa, thus demonstrating that resource partitioning occurs with relatively simple organic substrates. The Chip-SIP approach expands the repertoire of stable isotope-enabled methods available to microbial ecologists and provides a means to test genomics-generated hypotheses about biogeochemical function in any natural environment.},

We challenge the Type I error paradigm that underlies these corrections. Moreover we posit that the problem of multiple comparisons can disappear entirely when viewed from a hierarchical Bayesian perspective. We propose building multilevel models in the settings where multiple comparisons arise. Multilevel models perform partial pooling (shifting estimates toward each other), whereas classical procedures typically keep the centers of intervals stationary, adjusting for multiple comparisons by making the intervals wider (or, equivalently, adjusting the p values corresponding to intervals of fixed width). Thus, multilevel models address the multiple comparisons problem and also yield more efficient estimates, especially in settings with low group-level variation, which is where multiple comparisons are a particular concern.},

  abstract = {Almost all animals and plants are inhabited by diverse communities of microorganisms, the microbiota, thereby forming an integrated entity, the metaorganism. Natural selection should favor hosts that shape the community composition of these microbes to promote a beneficial host-microbe symbiosis. Indeed, animal hosts often pose selective environments, which only a subset of the environmentally available microbes are able to colonize. How these microbes assemble after colonization to form the complex microbiota is less clear. Neutral models are based on the assumption that the alternatives in microbiota community composition are selectively equivalent and thus entirely shaped by random population dynamics and dispersal. Here, we use the neutral model as a null hypothesis to assess microbiata composition in host organisms, which does not rely on invoking any adaptive processes underlying microbial community assembly. We show that the overall microbiota community structure from a wide range of host organisms, in particular including previously understudied invertebrates, is in many cases consistent with neutral expectations. Our approach allows to identify individual microbes that are deviating from the neutral expectation and are therefore interesting candidates for further study. Moreover, using simulated communities, we demonstrate that transient community states may play a role in the deviations from the neutral expectation. Our findings highlight that the consideration of neutral processes and temporal changes in community composition are critical for an in-depth understanding of microbiota-host interactions.},

So far, most studies have focused on the ecological consequences of above-ground biodiversity loss; yet a large part of Earth's biodiversity is literally hidden below ground. Whether reductions of biodiversity in soil communities below ground have consequences for the overall performance of an ecosystem remains unresolved. It is important to investigate this in view of recent observations that soil biodiversity is declining and that soil communities are changing upon land use intensification. We established soil communities differing in composition and diversity and tested their impact on eight ecosystem functions in model grassland communities. We show that soil biodiversity loss and simplification of soil community composition impair multiple ecosystem functions, including plant diversity, decomposition, nutrient retention, and nutrient cycling. The average response of all measured ecosystem functions (ecosystem multifunctionality) exhibited a strong positive linear relationship to indicators of soil biodiversity, suggesting that soil community composition is a key factor in regulating ecosystem functioning. Our results indicate that changes in soil communities and the loss of soil biodiversity threaten ecosystem multifunctionality and sustainability.},

  abstract = {In soil, the link between microbial diversity and carbon transformations is challenged by the concept of functional redundancy. Here, we hypothesized that functional redundancy may decrease with increasing carbon source recalcitrance and that coupling of diversity with C cycling may change accordingly. We manipulated microbial diversity to examine how diversity decrease affects the decomposition of easily degradable (i.e., allochthonous plant residues) versus recalcitrant (i.e., autochthonous organic matter) C sources. We found that a decrease in microbial diversity (i) affected the decomposition of both autochthonous and allochthonous carbon sources, thereby reducing global CO2 emission by up to 40\%, and (ii) shaped the source of CO2 emission toward preferential decomposition of most degradable C sources. Our results also revealed that the significance of the diversity effect increases with nutrient availability. Altogether, these findings show that C cycling in soil may be more vulnerable to microbial diversity changes than expected from previous studies, particularly in ecosystems exposed to nutrient inputs. Thus, concern about the preservation of microbial diversity may be highly relevant in the current global-change context assumed to impact soil biodiversity and the pulse inputs of plant residues and rhizodeposits into the soil.
IMPORTANCE With hundreds of thousands of taxa per gram of soil, microbial diversity dominates soil biodiversity. While numerous studies have established that microbial communities respond rapidly to environmental changes, the relationship between microbial diversity and soil functioning remains controversial. Using a well-controlled laboratory approach, we provide empirical evidence that microbial diversity may be of high significance for organic matter decomposition, a major process on which rely many of the ecosystem services provided by the soil ecosystem. These new findings should be taken into account in future studies aimed at understanding and predicting the functional consequences of changes in microbial diversity on soil ecosystem services and carbon storage in soil.},

  volume = {8},
  issn = {20457758},
  abstract = {Disease acts as a powerful driver of evolution in natural host populations, yet individuals in a population often vary in their susceptibility to infection. Energetic tradeoffs between immune and reproductive investment lead to the evolution of distinct life history strategies, driven by the relative fitness costs and benefits of resisting infection. However, examples quantifying the cost of resistance outside of the laboratory are rare. Here, we observe two distinct forms of resistance to bovine tuberculosis (bTB), an important zoonotic pathogen, in a free-ranging African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) population. We characterize these phenotypes as ``infection resistance,'' in which hosts delay or prevent infection, and ``proliferation resistance,'' in which the host limits the spread of lesions caused by the pathogen after infection has occurred. We found weak evidence that infection resistance to bTB may be heritable in this buffalo population (h2 = 0.10) and comes at the cost of reduced body condition and marginally reduced survival once infected, but also associates with an overall higher reproductive rate. Infection-resistant animals thus appear to follow a ``fast'' pace-of-life syndrome, in that they reproduce more quickly but die upon infection. In contrast, proliferation resistance had no apparent costs and was associated with measures of positive host health\textemdash{}such as having a higher body condition and reproductive rate. This study quantifies striking phenotypic variation in pathogen resistance and provides evidence for a link between life history variation and a disease resistance trait in a wild mammalian host population.},

In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate.

In this study, we consider score-based tests by choosing a statistic linear in the score function. When the model under the null hypothesis has only one error variance parameter, our test is exact in finite samples. When the null model has more than one variance parameter, we develop a new moment-based approximation that performs well in simulations.

Each of these makes different assumptions about the fundamental biology of the human-microbe system, with important implications for how we choose to study microbiomes, and the therapies we envision for correcting microbiome-linked disorders. We believe that it is time to move beyond metaphors, and we propose a scientifically pluralist approach that focuses on characterizing fundamental biological properties of microbiomes such as heritability, transmission mode, rates of dispersal rates, and strength of local selection.

The purpose of this article is to break these associations, which I think are incorrect and have been detrimental to statistical practice, in that they have steered falsificationists away from the very useful tools of Bayesian inference and have discouraged Bayesians from checking the fit of their models. From my experience using and developing Bayesian methods in social and environmental science, I have found model checking and falsification to be central in the modeling process.},

  abstract = {Recursive partitioning methods have become popular and widely used tools for nonparametric regression and classification in many scientific fields. Especially random forests, which can deal with large numbers of predictor variables even in the presence of complex interactions, have been applied successfully in genetics, clinical medicine, and bioinformatics within the past few years. High-dimensional problems are common not only in genetics, but also in some areas of psychological research, where only a few subjects can be measured because of time or cost constraints, yet a large amount of data is generated for each subject. Random forests have been shown to achieve a high prediction accuracy in such applications and to provide descriptive variable importance measures reflecting the impact of each variable in both main effects and interactions. The aim of this work is to introduce the principles of the standard recursive partitioning methods as well as recent methodological improvements, to illustrate their usage for low and high-dimensional data exploration, but also to point out limitations of the methods and potential pitfalls in their practical application. Application of the methods is illustrated with freely available implementations in the R system for statistical computing.},

The intramolecular distribution of (15)N in N(2)O provides a basis for distinguishing biological pathways. Concentrated cell suspensions of Methylococcus capsulatus Bath and Nitrosomonas europaea were used to investigate the site preference of N(2)O by microbial processes during nitrification. The average site preference of N(2)O formed during hydroxylamine oxidation by M. capsulatus Bath (5.5 +/- 3.5 per thousand) and N. europaea (-2.3 +/- 1.9 per thousand) and nitrite reduction by N. europaea (-8.3 +/- 3.6 per thousand) differed significantly (ANOVA, f((2,35)) = 247.9, p = 0). These results demonstrate that the mechanisms for hydroxylamine oxidation are distinct in M. capsulatus Bath and N. europaea. The average delta(18)O-N(2)O values of N(2)O formed during hydroxylamine oxidation for M. capsulatus Bath (53.1 +/- 2.9 per thousand) and N. europaea (-23.4 +/- 7.2 per thousand) and nitrite reduction by N. europaea (4.6 +/- 1.4 per thousand) were significantly different (ANOVA, f((2,35)) = 279.98, p = 0). Although the nitrogen isotope value of the substrate, hydroxylamine, was similar in both cultures, the observed fractionation (delta(15)N) associated with N(2)O production via hydroxylamine oxidation by M. capsulatus Bath and N. europaea (-2.3 and 26.0 per thousand, respectively) provided evidence that differences in isotopic fractionation were associated with these two organisms. The site preferences in this study are the first measured values for isolated microbial processes. The differences in site preference are significant and indicate that isotopomers provide a basis for apportioning biological processes producing N(2)O.},

  abstract = {Although a significant amount of the organic C stored in soil resides in subsurface horizons, the dynamics of subsurface C stores are not well understood. The objective of this study was to determine if changes in soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels have similar effects on the mineralization of surface (0\textendash{}25 cm) and subsurface (below 25 cm) C stores. Samples were collected from a 2 m deep unsaturated mollisol profile located near Santa Barbara, CA, USA. In a series of experiments, we measured the influence of nutrient additions (N and P), soil temperature (10\textendash{}35\textdegree{}C), and soil water potential (-0.5 to -10 MPa) on the microbial mineralization of native soil organic C. Surface and subsurface soils were slightly different with respect to the effects of water potential on microbial CO2 production; C mineralization rates in surface soils were more affected by conditions of moderate drought than rates in subsurface soils. With respect to the effects of soil temperature and nutrient levels on C mineralization rates, subsurface horizons were significantly more sensitive to increases in temperature or nutrient availability than surface horizons. The mean Q10 value for C mineralization rates was 3.0 in surface horizons and 3.9 in subsurface horizons. The addition of either N or P had negligible effects on microbial CO2 production in surface soil layers; in the subsurface horizons, the addition of either N or P increased CO2 production by up to 450\% relative to the control. The results of these experiments suggest that alterations of the soil environment may have different effects on CO2 production through the profile and that the mineralization of subsurface C stores may be particularly susceptible to increases in temperature or nutrient inputs to soil.},

The position information is obtained from successive measurement of the isotopic composition of the N(2)O(+) ion at m/z 44, 45, 46 and the NO(+) fragment ion at m/z 30, 31. The fragment ion analysis is complicated by a non-linearity in the mass spectrometer that has to be taken into account. Evaluation of the absolute peak areas allows for a simultaneous determination of the N(2)O mixing ratio for atmospheric samples. Samples with mixing ratios ranging from a few nmol/mol up to the percent level can be analyzed using different sample inlet systems. The high concentration inlet system provides an easy and quick method to carry out various diagnostic tests, in particular to perform realistic linearity tests. A gas chromatographic set-up with a split column and a backflush possibility improves analytical precision and excludes interferences by substances with long retention times from preceding runs. We also describe a new open split interface that uses only a single transfer capillary to the mass spectrometer for sample and reference gas.},

In a pristine forest soil, a gradual increase in soil temperature from 5 to 25 degrees C in a range of water contents stimulated N turnover rates, and N gas emissions were determined by the soil water-filled pore space (WFPS). NO and N(2)O emissions dominated at 30\% WFPS and 55\% WFPS, respectively, and the step-wise temperature increase resulted in a threefold increase in the NO(3)- concentrations and a decrease in the NH(4)+ concentration. At 70\% WFPS, NH(4)+ accumulated while NO(3)- pools declined, indicating gaseous N loss. AmoA- and nirK-gene-based analysis revealed increasing abundance of bacterial ammonia oxidizers (AOB) with increasing soil temperature and a decrease in the abundance of archaeal ammonia oxidizers (AOA) in wet soil at 25 degrees C, suggesting the sensitivity of the latter to anaerobic conditions. Denitrifier (nirK) community structure was most affected by the water content and nirK gene abundance rapidly increased in response to wet conditions until the substrate (NO(3)-) became limiting. Shifts in the community structure were most pronounced for nirK and most rapid for AOA, indicating dynamic populations, whereas distinct adaptation of the AOB communities required 5 weeks, suggesting higher stability.},

  abstract = {The feedbacks between plant and soil processes play an important role in driving forest succession. One poorly understood feedback mechanism is the interaction between plant secondary chemicals and soil microbes. In the Alaskan taiga, changes in nutrient cycling caused by balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) secondary chemicals may affect the transition from alder (Alnus tenuifolia) to balsam poplar on river floodplains. We examined the effects of four poplar condensed tannin fractions on N cycling in alder and poplar soils. Tannins were added to forest floor samples from both poplar and alder sites. Samples were incubated for 1 month in the laboratory with soil respiration rates measured over the course of the incubation. At the end of the incubation we measured both net and gross nitrogen mineralization and nitrification, microbial biomass C and N, and the activity of various exoenzymes. In all soils, tannin additions reduced N availability, however, the mechanisms differed depending on the molecular weight of the tannin and the native soil microbial community. Low molecular weight tannin fractions served as a labile C source in poplar Oi, poplar Oe, and alder Oe horizons but were toxic to microbes in alder Oi. High molecular weight tannin fractions appeared to act primarily by binding extracellular substrates and thus limiting C and N mineralization, with the strongest effects observed in the alder soils. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {Here, we examine the effect of long-term pH differences and short-term pH change on N2O emissions from soil, and the microbial source (ammonia oxidation versus denitrification) of 15N-N2O emissions. 15N-fertiliser (20 g N m-2; 10 atom\% excess 15N) was applied to (1) a silt loam soil of pH 7 held at 50\% and 65\% water-filled pore space (WFPS) (experiment 1) and (2) a loamy sand soil maintained at pH 4.5 and pH 7 for over 40 years (experiment 2). Soils were limed with CaCO3 or acidified with H2SO4, and comparisons were made with unadjusted soils. Ammonia oxidation was the main microbial source of 15N-N2O in soils limed to pH 7.0\textendash{}8.1, unadjusted pH 7.1 (Experiment 1) and long-term pH 7 (experiment 2) soils. Eighty percent of 15N-N2O from the long-term pH 4.5 soil (experiment 2) was derived from denitrification suggesting a possible inhibition of N2O reduction. Short-term acidification to pH 5.6 or 4.3 lowered N2O emissions. Liming of the pH 4.5 soil resulted in over four times greater N2O emission (11 mg 14+15N-N2O m-2 over 41 days) than from the long-term pH 7.0 soil (experiment 2), with an associated increase in ammonia oxidiser-N2O and decrease in denitrifier-N2O production. This is the first report of a pH-induced change in microbial source of N2O. Our results highlight the importance of distinguishing between short- and long-term effects of pH management when predicting N2O emissions from soil, as they exhibit predominance of different microbial groups in N2O production, with likely adaptation of the microbial community.},

We present the current understanding of the importance of microbial substrate use efficiency and C and N allocation in controlling the proportion of plant-derived C and N that is incorporated into SOM, and of soil matrix interactions in controlling SOM stabilization. We synthesize this understanding into the Microbial Efficiency-Matrix Stabilization (MEMS) framework. This framework leads to the hypothesis that labile plant constituents are the dominant source of microbial products, relative to input rates, because they are utilized more efficiently by microbes. These microbial products of decomposition would thus become the main precursors of stable SOM by promoting aggregation and through strong chemical bonding to the mineral soil matrix. \textcopyright{} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  volume = {85},
  issn = {01682563},
  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a structure for organo-mineral associations in soils based on recent insights concerning the molecular structure of soil organic matter (SOM), and on extensive published evidence from empirical studies of organo-mineral interfaces. Our conceptual model assumes that SOM consists of a heterogeneous mixture of compounds that display a range of amphiphilic or surfactant-like properties, and are capable of self-organization in aqueous solution. An extension of this self-organizational behavior in solution, we suggest that SOM sorbs to mineral surfaces in a discrete zonal sequence. In the contact zone, the formation of particularly strong organo-mineral associations appears to be favored by situations where either (i) polar organic functional groups of amphiphiles interact via ligand exchange with singly coordinated mineral hydroxyls, forming stable inner-sphere complexes, or (ii) proteinaceous materials unfold upon adsorption, thus increasing adhesive strength by adding hydrophobic interactions to electrostatic binding. Entropic considerations dictate that exposed hydrophobic portions of amphiphilic molecules adsorbed directly to mineral surfaces be shielded from the polar aqueous phase through association with hydrophobic moieties of other amphiphilic molecules. This process can create a membrane-like bilayer containing a hydrophobic zone, whose components may exchange more easily with the surrounding soil solution than those in the contact zone, but which are still retained with considerable force. Sorbed to the hydrophilic exterior of hemimicellar coatings, or to adsorbed proteins, are organic molecules forming an outer region, or kinetic zone, that is loosely retained by cation bridging, hydrogen bonding, and other interactions. Organic material in the kinetic zone may experience high exchange rates with the surrounding soil solution, leading to short residence times for individual molecular fragments. The thickness of this outer region would depend more on input than on the availability of binding sites, and would largely be controlled by exchange kinetics. Movement of organics into and out of this outer region can thus be viewed as similar to a phase-partitioning process. The zonal concept of organo-mineral interactions presented here offers a new basis for understanding and predicting the retention of organic compounds, including contaminants, in soils and sediments. \textcopyright{} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide is produced from denitrification and nitrification processes in soils, and contributes to global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion. Laboratory experiments with six soils ranging in clay content between 4\textendash{}12\% were designed to investigate the effect of water and temperature on the partitioning of N2O from denitrification and nitrification. The nitrification rates at 70\% field capacity (FC) were significantly higher in the loamy soils (980\textendash{}1440 {$\mu$}g N kg-1 soil day-1) than in the sandy soils (60\textendash{}460 {$\mu$}g N kg-1 soil day-1). The nitrous oxide produced by nitrification differed similarly between the soil types resulting in ratios of N2ON relative to NO3-N, which were only ranging from 0.28 to 0.48\% with an average of 0.39\%, indicating a rather constant relationship between nitrification and nitrous oxide emission. Maximum nitrification rates occured at 20\textdegree{}C and 100\% filed capacity (FC) and was 13 at 40\% FC. At lower temperatures only small responses to changes in soil moisture were observed. The percentage of N2ON produced by nitrification increased with increased siol moisture (0.49\% at 40\% FC and 0.93\% at 100\% FC) and decreased with increasing temperature (0.49\% at 5\textdegree{}C and 0.17\% at 20\textdegree{}C). The denitrification activity (N2 + N2O) in the sandy loam soil responded significantly to both increased soil moisture and increased temperature, whereas the coarse sandy soil only reacted to increased temperature. In the coarse sandy soil the Q10-values were in the range from 1.9 to 3.4, and the values were ranging from 4.9 to 8.9 in the sandy loam soil. As for the denitrification activity also the N2 to N2O ratio increased exponentially with increasing temperature, which implies a linear relationship between the log(N2 to N2O ratio) and the temperature. The N2 to N2O ratios were lower in the coarse sandy soil than in the sandy loam soil, and were in the range from 0 to 16.},

  volume = {53},
  issn = {00953628},
  abstract = {Primary succession is a fundamental process in macroecosystems; however, if and how soil development influences microbial community structure is poorly understood. Thus, we investigated changes in the bacterial community along a chronosequence of three unvegetated, early successional soils ( approximately 20-year age gradient) from a receding glacier in southeastern Peru using molecular phylogenetic techniques. We found that evenness, phylogenetic diversity, and the number of phylotypes were lowest in the youngest soils, increased in the intermediate aged soils, and plateaued in the oldest soils. This increase in diversity was commensurate with an increase in the number of sequences related to common soil bacteria in the older soils, including members of the divisions Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Verrucomicrobia. Sequences related to the Comamonadaceae clade of the Betaproteobacteria were dominant in the youngest soil, decreased in abundance in the intermediate age soil, and were not detected in the oldest soil. These sequences are closely related to culturable heterotrophs from rock and ice environments, suggesting that they originated from organisms living within or below the glacier. Sequences related to a variety of nitrogen (N)-fixing clades within the Cyanobacteria were abundant along the chronosequence, comprising 6-40\% of phylotypes along the age gradient. Although there was no obvious change in the overall abundance of cyanobacterial sequences along the chronosequence, there was a dramatic shift in the abundance of specific cyanobacterial phylotypes, with the intermediate aged soils containing the greatest diversity of these sequences. Most soil biogeochemical characteristics showed little change along this approximately 20-year soil age gradient; however, soil N pools significantly increased with soil age, perhaps as a result of the activity of the N-fixing Cyanobacteria. Our results suggest that, like macrobial communities, soil microbial communities are structured by substrate age, and that they, too, undergo predictable changes through time.},

  abstract = {Agricultural lands occupy 37\% of the earth's land surface. Agriculture accounts for 52 and 84\% of global anthropogenic methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Agricultural soils may also act as a sink or source for CO2, but the net flux is small. Many agricultural practices can potentially mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the most prominent of which are improved cropland and grazing land management and restoration of degraded lands and cultivated organic soils. Lower, but still significant mitigation potential is provided by water and rice management, set-aside, land use change and agroforestry, livestock management and manure management. The global technical mitigation potential from agriculture (excluding fossil fuel offsets from biomass) by 2030, considering all gases, is estimated to be approximately 5500-6000Mt CO2-eq.yr-1, with economic potentials of approximately 1500-1600, 2500-2700 and 4000-4300Mt CO2-eq.yr-1 at carbon prices of up to 20, up to 50 and up to 100 US\$ t CO2-eq.-1, respectively. In addition, GHG emissions could be reduced by substitution of fossil fuels for energy production by agricultural feedstocks (e.g. crop residues, dung and dedicated energy crops). The economic mitigation potential of biomass energy from agriculture is estimated to be 640, 2240 and 16 000Mt CO2-eq.yr-1 at 0-20, 0-50 and 0-100 US\$ t CO2-eq.-1, respectively.},

  issn = {1810-6285},
  abstract = {pAgronomical and environmental benefits are associated with replacing winter fallow by cover crops (CC). Yet, the effect of this practice on nitrous oxide (Nsub2/subO) emissions remains poorly understood. In this context, a field experiment was carried out under Mediterranean conditions to evaluate the effect of replacing the traditional winter fallow (F) by vetch (iVicia sativa/i L.; V) or barley (iHordeum vulgare/i L.; B) on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during the intercrop and the maize (iZea mays/i L.) cropping period. The maize was fertilized following Integrated Soil Fertility management (ISFM) criteria. Maize nitrogen (N) uptake, soil mineral N concentrations, soil temperature and moisture, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and GHG fluxes were measured during the experiment. The ISFM resulted in low cumulative Nsub2/subO emissions (0.57 to 0.75 kg Nsub2/subO-N hasup\&minus;1/sup), yield-scaled Nsub2/subO emissions (3\&ndash;6 g Nsub2/subO-N kg aboveground N uptakesup\&minus;1/sup) and N surplus (31 to 56 kg N hasup\&minus;1/sup) for all treatments. Although CCs increased Nsub2/subO emissions during the intercrop period compared to F (1.6 and 2.6 times in B and V, respectively), the ISFM resulted in similar cumulative emissions for the CCs and F at the end of the maize cropping period. The higher C:N ratio of the B residue led to a greater proportion of Nsub2/subO losses from the synthetic fertilizer in these plots, when compared to V. No significant differences were observed in CHsub4/sub and COsub2/sub fluxes at the end of the experiment. This study shows that the use of both legume and non-legume CCs combined with ISFM could provide, in addition to the advantages reported in previous studies, an opportunity to maximize agronomic efficiency (lowering synthetic N requirements for the subsequent cash crop) without increasing cumulative or yield-scaled Nsub2/subO losses./p},

  abstract = {Although bacteria within the Verrucomicrobia phylum are pervasive in soils around the world, they are underrepresented in both isolate collections and genomic databases. Here we describe a single verrucomicrobial phylotype within the class Spartobacteria that is not closely related to any previously described taxa. We examined 1000 soils and found this spartobacterial phylotype to be ubiquitous and consistently one of the most abundant soil bacterial phylotypes, particularly in grasslands, where it was typically the most abundant phylotype. We reconstructed a nearly complete genome of this phylotype from a soil metagenome for which we propose the provisional name 'Candidatus Udaeobacter copiosus'. The Ca. U. copiosus genome is unusually small for soil bacteria, estimated to be only 2.81 Mbp compared to the predicted effective mean genome size of 4.74 Mbp for soil bacteria. Metabolic reconstruction suggests that Ca. U. copiosus is an aerobic chemoorganoheterotroph with numerous amino acid and vitamin auxotrophies. The large population size, relatively small genome and multiple putative auxotrophies characteristic of Ca. U. copiosus suggests that it may be undergoing streamlining selection to minimize cellular architecture, a phenomenon previously thought to be restricted to aquatic bacteria. Although many soil bacteria need relatively large, complex genomes to be successful in soil, Ca. U. copiosus appears to have identified an alternate strategy, sacrificing metabolic versatility for efficiency to become dominant in the soil environment.},

  abstract = {Emissions of N2O were measured following combined applications of inorganic N fertiliser and crop residues to a silt loam soil in S. E. England, UK. Effects of cultivation technique and residue application on N2O emissions were examined over 2 years. N2O emissions were increased in the presence of residues and were further increased where NH4NO3 fertiliser (200 kg N ha(-1)) was applied. Large fluxes of N2O were measured from the zero till treatments after residue and fertiliser application, with 2.5 kg N2O- N ha(-1) measured over the first 23 days after application of fertiliser in combination with rye ( Secale cereale) residues under zero tillage. CO2 emissions were larger in the zero till than in the conventional till treatments. A significant tillage/residue interaction was found. Highest emissions were measured from the conventionally tilled bean ( Vicia faba) (1.0 kg N2O- N ha(-1) emitted over 65 days) and zero tilled rye (3.5 kg N2O-N ha(-1) over 65 days) treatments. This was attributed to rapid release of N following incorporation of bean residues in the conventionally tilled treatments, and availability of readily degradable C from the rye in the presence of anaerobic conditions under the mulch in the zero tilled treatments. Measurement of N-15-N2O emission following application of N-15-labelled fertiliser to microplots indicated that surface mulching of residues in zero till treatments resulted in a greater proportion of fertiliser N being lost as N2O than with incorporation of residues. Combined applications of N-15 fertiliser and bean residues resulted in higher or lower emissions, depending on cultivation technique, when compared with the sum of N2O from single applications. Such interactions have important implications for mitigation of N2O from agricultural soils.},

  abstract = {Soils are the major source of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) to our atmosphere. A thorough understanding of terrestrial N2O production is therefore essential. N2O can be produced by nitrifiers, denitrifiers, and by nitrifiers paradoxically denitrifying. The latter pathway, though well-known in pure culture, has only recently been demonstrated in soils. Moreover, nitrifier denitrification appeared to be much less important than classical nitrate-driven denitrification. Here we studied a poor sandy soil, and show that when moisture conditions are sub-optimal for denitrification, nitrifier denitrification can be a major contributor to N2O emission from this soil. We conclude that the relative importance of classical and nitrifier denitrification in N2O emitted from soil is a function of the soil moisture content, and likely of other environmental conditions as well. Accordingly, we suggest that nitrifier denitrification should be routinely considered as a major source of N2O from soil. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Because of potential increases in infiltration with NT, a better understanding of tillage effects on NO3--N leaching is required. An experiment was conducted in central Pennsylvania on a Hagerstown silt loam (fine, mixed, semiactive, mesic Typic Hapludalf) to study NO3--N leaching under chisel. till and NT and to compare results from zero-tension pan and passive capillary fiberglass wick lysimeters from May 1995 to April 2001. Pan lysimeters collected greater leachate volumes from NT than from tilled treatments during the growing season, likely due to greater macropore flow in NT soil. When leachate collection efficiency corrected values were used, pan and wick lysimeters collected equivalent masses of NO3--N. Flow weighted NO3--N concentrations in leachate in both lysimeter types were also similar. Tillage had no effect on total leachate collected during the 6-yr experiment by either pan (228 mm yr(-1)) or wick (558 mm yr(-1)) lysimeters. Flow-weighted NO3--N concentrations and NO3--N masses in leachate were not significantly different between tilled and NT, but increased with increasing N-rate (at 0, 100, and 200 kg N ha(-1), flow-weighted NO3--N concentrations were 3.5, 8.2, and 23.9 mg L-1 and NO3--N masses were 17. 39, and 112 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively).

Using a global-scale compilation of \~35,000 sites and \~5.6\textperiodcentered{}106 species, we demonstrate similar rates of scaling in commonness and rarity across microorganisms and macroscopic plants and animals. We document a universal dominance scaling law that holds across 30 orders of magnitude, an unprecedented expanse that predicts the abundance of dominant ocean bacteria. In combining this scaling law with the lognormal model of species abundance, we predict that Earth is home to \~1012 microbial species. This estimate is also supported by the microbial richness scaling relationship we derive from the largest ever inventory of high-throughput molecular data. Microbial biodiversity seems greater than ever anticipated yet predictable from the smallest to the largest microbiome.},

  issn = {0032079X},
  abstract = {The relationship between soil structure and the ability of soil to stabilize soil organic matter (SOM) is a key element in soil C dynamics that has either been overlooked or treated in a cursory fashion when developing SOM models. The purpose of this paper is to review current knowledge of SOM dynamics within the framework of a newly proposed soil C saturation concept. Initially, we distinguish SOM that is protected against decomposition by various mechanisms from that which is not protected from decomposition. Methods of quantification and characteristics of three SOM pools defined as protected are discussed. Soil organic matter can be: (1) physically stabilized, or protected from decomposition, through microaggregation, or (2) intimate association with silt and clay particles, and (3) can be biochemically stabilized through the formation of recalcitrant SOM compounds. In addition to behavior of each SOM pool, we discuss implications of changes in land management on processes by which SOM compounds undergo protection and release. The characteristics and responses to changes in land use or land management are described for the light fraction (LF) and particulate organic matter (POM). We defined the LF and POM not occluded within microaggregates (53-250 mum sized aggregates as unprotected. Our conclusions are illustrated in a new conceptual SOM model that differs from most SOM models in that the model state variables are measurable SOM pools. We suggest that physicochemical characteristics inherent to soils define the maximum protective capacity of these pools, which limits increases in SOM (i.e. C sequestration) with increased organic residue inputs.},

  abstract = {Plant-associated microorganisms have been shown to critically affect host physiology and performance, suggesting that evolution and ecology of plants and animals can only be understood in a holobiont (host and its associated organisms) context. Host-associated microbial community structures are affected by abiotic and host factors, and increased attention is given to the role of the microbiome in interactions such as pathogen inhibition. However, little is known about how these factors act on the microbial community, and especially what role microbe-microbe interaction dynamics play. We have begun to address this knowledge gap for phyllosphere microbiomes of plants by simultaneously studying three major groups of Arabidopsis thaliana symbionts (bacteria, fungi and oomycetes) using a systems biology approach. We evaluated multiple potential factors of microbial community control: we sampled various wild A. thaliana populations at different times, performed field plantings with different host genotypes, and implemented successive host colonization experiments under lab conditions where abiotic factors, host genotype, and pathogen colonization was manipulated. Our results indicate that both abiotic factors and host genotype interact to affect plant colonization by all three groups of microbes. Considering microbe-microbe interactions, however, uncovered a network of interkingdom interactions with significant contributions to community structure. As in other scale-free networks, a small number of taxa, which we call microbial "hubs," are strongly interconnected and have a severe effect on communities. By documenting these microbe-microbe interactions, we uncover an important mechanism explaining how abiotic factors and host genotypic signatures control microbial communities. In short, they act directly on "hub" microbes, which, via microbe-microbe interactions, transmit the effects to the microbial community. We analyzed two "hub" microbes (the obligate biotrophic oomycete pathogen Albugo and the basidiomycete yeast fungus Dioszegia) more closely. Albugo had strong effects on epiphytic and endophytic bacterial colonization. Specifically, alpha diversity decreased and beta diversity stabilized in the presence of Albugo infection, whereas they otherwise varied between plants. Dioszegia, on the other hand, provided evidence for direct hub interaction with phyllosphere bacteria. The identification of microbial "hubs" and their importance in phyllosphere microbiome structuring has crucial implications for plant-pathogen and microbe-microbe research and opens new entry points for ecosystem management and future targeted biocontrol. The revelation that effects can cascade through communities via "hub" microbes is important to understand community structure perturbations in parallel fields including human microbiomes and bioprocesses. In particular, parallels to human microbiome "keystone" pathogens and microbes open new avenues of interdisciplinary research that promise to better our understanding of functions of host-associated microbiomes.},

Organic farming systems produce lower yields compared with conventional agriculture. However, they are more profitable and environmentally friendly, and deliver equally or more nutritious foods that contain less (or no) pesticide residues, compared with conventional farming. Moreover, initial evidence indicates that organic agricultural systems deliver greater ecosystem services and social benefits. Although organic agriculture has an untapped role to play when it comes to the establishment of sustainable farming systems, no single approach will safely feed the planet. Rather, a blend of organic and other innovative farming systems is needed.

  abstract = {Similar temporal patterns were found in three mineral soils for the composition of the gaseous products of denitrification following the onset of anaerobic conditions. During the early period of anaerobiosis (0 up to 1 to 3 h), N(2) was the dominant product of denitrification. The NO(3) -- N(2)O activity then increased, but was not accompanied by a corresponding increase in N(2)O-reducing activity. This resulted in a relatively extended period of time (1 to 3 up to 16 to 33 h) during which N(2)O was a major product. Eventually (after 16 to 33 h), an increase in N(2)O-reducing activity occurred without a comparable increase in the N(2)O-producing activity. The increase in the rate of N(2)O reduction did not occur in the presence of chloramphenicol and required the presence of N(2)O or NO(3) during the preceding anaerobic incubation. During the final period (16 to 33, up to 48 h), N(2) was generally the sole product of denitrification, since the rate of N(2)O reduction exceeded the rate of N(2)O production. A similar sequential pattern was also found for a culture of a denitrifying Flavobacterium sp. shifted to anaerobic growth. A staggered synthesis of the enzymes in the denitrification sequence apparently occurred in response to anoxia, which caused first a net production of N(2)O followed by consumption of N(2)O.},

Three natural organic (dairy and swine compost and a biosolid) and two synthetic organic nutrient sources (readily available ureaand controlled-release N source sulfur-coated urea) were applied at rates of 50 and 100 kg N ha-' per application (200 kg ha-' yr-1). Runoff water collected from 33 storms and composite monthly lea- chate samples collected with ion exchange resins were analyzed for nitrate (NO 3 -N), phosphate (POV3-P), and ammonium (NHJ-N). Nutrient concentrations and losses in both runoff and leachate were highest for the 20-wk period following turfgrass seeding. The NO;-N and Nm-N losses declined significantly once turfgrass cover was established, but P04--P levels increased in Year 2. Turf's ability to reduce nutrient runoffand leachate was related to overall plant growth and shoot density. The use of natural organics resulted in greater P loss on a percent applied P basis, while the more soluble synthetic organics resulted in greater N loss.},

We used acetylene (10 Pa) to selectively inhibit N2O production by nitrifiers, 100 kPa (100\% v/v) O2 to inhibit N2O production by denitrifiers, and sterilized soil to evaluate chemical sources of N2O. Individual soil cores were incubated in a recirculating atmosphere system under air, 100 kPa O, and air + 10 Pa C2H2 atmospheres for 3\textendash{}4 h under each condition. Rates of N2O production in air ranged from 2.8 to 8.5 ng N g-1 h-1 in soils from the Rose Lake site and from 0.1 to 0.94 ng N g-1 h-1 in soils from Warren Woods. The importance of specific N2O sources in these soils varied among soil cores within each site. In the recently disturbed, more fertile Rose Lake site nitrifiers and denitrifiers were both important N2O sources, but in many cores a significant portion of the N2O flux was inhibited by neither acetylene nor O2, implying an alternate N2O source. Sterilized soil produced little N2O, which suggests that the alternate source is biological. In the old-growth Warren Woods site nitrifiers were significant but relatively unimportant sources of N2O. O2 consistently stimulated rather than inhibited N2O production in cores from this site, suggesting (a) that denitrifiers in this site are a sink for N2O produced by other sources, and (b) that most of the N2O produced in this site is from sources other than nitrification and denitrification. Biological sources of N2O other than nitrifiers and denitrifiers were not further identified, although low soil pH values suggest that fungi may be important.},

  abstract = {A model of soil nitrogen dynamics under competing intercrops is described and used to interpret two sets of experimental field data from the literature. In one series of experiments, maize received slurry and mineral nitrogen (N) fertiliser or mineral N alone and was grown either alone or intercropped with undersown grass or with a subsequent rye catch crop during 7 years continuously. In the second system, the model compares field beans intercropped spatially at different densities with winter wheat. The model suggests that undersowing grass between the rows of an established maize crop can reduce concentrations of nitrate in water draining from soils during winter by 15 mg l-1 compared with a conventional catch crop and by more than 20 mg l-1 compared with a fallow soil. The model further suggests that the yield and profitability of mixed stands of commercial crops is inversely related to the residual nitrate at harvest (potential leaching). It is concluded that intercropping may be a useful means to reduce nutrient pollution from farming while maintaining yields. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  volume = {13},
  issn = {13541013},
  abstract = {This experiment was designed to study three determinant factors in decomposition patterns of soil organic matter (SOM): temperature, water and carbon (C) inputs. The study combined field measurements with soil lab incubations and ends with a modelling framework based on the results obtained. Soil respiration was periodically measured at an oak savanna woodland and a ponderosa pine plantation. Intact soils cores were collected at both ecosystems, including soils with most labile C burnt off, soils with some labile C gone and soils with fresh inputs of labile C. Two treatments, dry-field condition and field capacity, were applied to an incubation that lasted 111 days. Short-term temperature changes were applied to the soils periodically to quantify temperature responses. This was done to prevent confounding results associated with different pools of C that would result by exposing treatments chronically to different temperature regimes. This paper discusses the role of the above-defined environmental factors on the variability of soil C dynamics. At the seasonal scale, temperature and water were, respectively, the main limiting factors controlling soil CO2 efflux for the ponderosa pine and the oak savanna ecosystems. Spatial and seasonal variations in plant activity (root respiration and exudates production) exerted a strong influence over the seasonal and spatial variation of soil metabolic activity. Mean residence times of bulk SOM were significantly lower at the Nitrogen (N)-rich deciduous savanna than at the N-limited evergreen dominated pine ecosystem. At shorter time scales (daily), SOM decomposition was controlled primarily by temperature during wet periods and by the combined effect of water and temperature during dry periods. Secondary control was provided by the presence/absence of plant derived C inputs (exudation). Further analyses of SOM decomposition suggest that factors such as changes in the decomposer community, stress-induced changes in the metabolic activity of decomposers or SOM stabilization patterns remain unresolved, but should also be considered in future SOM decomposition studies. Observations and confounding factors associated with SOM decomposition patterns and its temperature sensitivity are summarized in the modeling framework.},

  abstract = {Conservation tillage practices are widely used to protect against soil erosion and soil C losses, whereas winter cover crops are used mainly to protect against N losses during autumn and winter. For the greenhouse gas balance of a cropping system the effect of reduced tillage and cover crops on N2O emissions may be more important than the effect on soil C. This study monitored emissions of N2O between September 2008 and May 2009 in three tillage treatments, i.e., conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT) and direct drilling (DD), all with (+CC) or without (-CC) fodder radish as a winter cover crop. Cover crop growth, soil mineral N dynamics, and other soil characteristics were recorded. Furthermore, soil concentrations of N2O were determined eight times during the monitoring period using permanently installed needles. There was little evidence for effects of the cover crop on soil mineral N. Following spring tillage and slurry application soil mineral N was dominated by the input from slurry. Nitrous oxide emissions during autumn, winter and early spring remained low, although higher emissions from +CC treatments were indicated after freezing events. Following spring tillage and slurry application by direct injection N2O emissions were stimulated in all tillage treatments, reaching 250-400 {$\mu$}g N m-2 h-1 except in the CT + CC treatment, where emissions peaked at 900 {$\mu$}g N m-2 h-1. Accumulated emissions ranged from 1.6 to 3.9 kg N2O ha-1. A strong positive interaction between cover crop and tillage was observed. Soil concentration profiles of N2O showed a significant accumulation of N2O in CT relative to RT and DD treatments after spring tillage and slurry application, and a positive interaction between slurry and cover crop residues. A comparison in early May of N2O emissions with flux estimates based on soil concentration profiles indicated that much of the N2O emitted was produced near the soil surface. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Permanganate oxidizable C (POXC; i.e., active C) is a relatively new meth- od that can quantify labile soil C rapidly and inexpensively. Despite limited reports of positive correlations with particulate organic C (POC), microbi- al biomass C (MBC), and other soil C fractions, little is known about what soil fractions POXC most closely refl ects. We measured POXC across a wide range of soil types, ecosystems, and geographic areas (12 studies, 53 total sites, n = 1379) to: (i) determine the relationship between POXC and POC, MBC and soil organic C (SOC) fractions, and (ii) determine the relative sen- sitivity of POXC as a labile soil C metric across a range of environmental and management conditions. Permanganate oxidizable C was signifi cantly related to POC, MBC, and SOC, and these relationships were strongest when data were analyzed by individual studies. Permanganate oxidizable C was more closely related to smaller-sized (53\textendash{}250 {$\mu$}m) than larger POC fractions (250\textendash{} 2000 {$\mu$}m), and more closely related to heavier (1.7 g cm-3) than lighter POC fractions, indicating that it refl ects a relatively processed pool of labile soil C. Compared with POC, MBC, or SOC, POXC demonstrated greater sen- sitivity to changes in management or environmental variation in 42\% of the signifi cant experimental factors examined across the 12 studies. Our analysis demonstrates the usefulness of POXC in quickly and inexpensively assessing changes in the labile soil C pool.},

  abstract = {Although roots are an important source of soil organic matter (SOM) and are thought to be the major constituent of the particulate organic matter (POM) fraction, few studies have documented the fate of belowground C inputs in situ. The main purpose of this experiment was to determine the fate of root-derived C vs. shoot-derived C and to identify factors contributing to any differences in the retention of aboveground vs. belowground C inputs. We labeled hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth subsp. villosa) in situ with 13CO2 and followed both root- and shoot-derived C in total soil organic C (SOC) and labile C pools for the first growing season following hairy vetch incorporation. At the end of the growing season, nearly one-half of the root-derived C was still present in the soil, whereas only 13\% of shoot-derived C remained. A greater proportion of root-derived C was found as occluded POM and associated with the clay and silt fraction. Greater root-derived C also was retained as chloroform-extractable microbial biomass. We suggest that three different mechanisms contributed to the increased retention of root-derived C: (i) the greater biochemical recalcitrance of root litter, (ii) increased physical protection of root-derived POM within aggregates, and (iii) the continuous nature of root C inputs from exudates and fine root turnover. We conclude that shoot residues are broken down rapidly and serve as the source of N for the following cash crop, whereas the root litter is probably largely responsible for the short-term soil structural improvements associated with the use of green manures. Furthermore, on the basis of these findings, we hypothesize that the greater retention of root-derived C in the first 6 mo of decomposition will increase the persistence of this C in SOM in the long term.},

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) is a major radiative forcing and stratospheric ozone-depleting gas emitted from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. It can be transformed to nitrogen gas (N(2)) by bacteria and archaea harboring the N(2)O reductase (N(2)OR), which is the only known N(2)O sink in the biosphere. Despite its crucial role in mitigating N(2)O emissions, knowledge of the N(2)OR in the environment remains limited. Here, we report a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the nosZ gene coding the N(2)OR in genomes retrieved from public databases. The resulting phylogeny revealed two distinct clades of nosZ, with one unaccounted for in studies investigating N(2)O-reducing communities. Examination of N(2)OR structural elements not considered in the phylogeny revealed that the two clades differ in their signal peptides, indicating differences in the translocation pathway of the N(2)OR across the membrane. Sequencing of environmental clones of the previously undetected nosZ lineage in various environments showed that it is widespread and diverse. Using quantitative PCR, we demonstrate that this clade was most often at least as abundant as the other, thereby more than doubling the known extent of the overall N(2)O-reducing community in the environment. Furthermore, we observed that the relative abundance of nosZ from either clade varied among habitat types and environmental conditions. Our results indicate a physiological dichotomy in the diversity of N(2)O-reducing microorganisms, which might be of importance for understanding the relationship between the diversity of N(2)O-reducing microorganisms and N(2)O reduction in different ecosystems.},

N-15-N2O emissions from (NH4NO3)-N-14-N-15 replicates were attributed to denitrification and N-15-N2O from (NH4NO3)-N-15-N-15 minus that from (NH4NO3)-N-14-N-15 replicates was attributed to nitrification and heterotrophic nitrification in the presence of acetylene, as there was no dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium or immobilisation and remineralisation of N-15-NO3-. All of the N2O emitted at 70\% WFPS (31.6 mg N2O-N m(-2) over 24 days; 1.12 mu g N2O-N g dry soil(-1); 0.16\% of N applied) was produced during denitrification, but at 35-60\% WFPS nitrification was the main process producing N2O, accounting for 81\% of N-15-N2O emitted at 60\% WFPS, and 7.9 mu g N-15-N2O m(-2) (0.28 ng N-15-N2O g dry soil(-1)) was estimated to be emitted over 7 days during heterotrophic nitrification in the 50\% WFPS treatment and accounted for 20\% of N-15-N2O from this treatment.

  issn = {00224561 (ISSN)},
  abstract = {Nitrate contamination of shallow groundwater has been widely documented in association with agriculture in the Coastal Plain region of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Elevated groundwater nitrate levels limit the use of shallow groundwater for human consumption and also result in elevated nonpoint source nitrogen (N) loads to Chesapeake Bay via elevated stream base-flow nitrate concentrations. This study investigated the effects of cereal grain winter cover crops on nitrate leaching rates, profile nitrate storage, and nitrate concentrations in shallow groundwater in two field-scale watersheds planted continuously in corn (Zea mays L.) from 1984 through 1996. Winter-fallow conditions were maintained following the 1984 through 1987 growing seasons and cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) as a cover crop was planted immediately after grain harvest from 1988 through 1996. Cover crop effects on nitrate leaching rates also were evaluated in continuous no-till corn plots from 1990 through 1995. Nitrate leaching losses from the root zone and recharge of shallow aquifers occurred primarily during winter months under conditions of low evapotranspiration. The potential for nitrate leaching losses was determined primarily by the availability of nitrate in the root zone at the onset of the winter groundwater recharge period. Rye winter cover crops planted after corn harvest consistently reduced nitrate-N concentrations in root zone leachate to less than 1 mg/L during most of the groundwater recharge period, and reduced annual nitrate leaching losses by approximately 80\% relative to winter-fallow treatments. Shallow groundwater nitrate-N concentrations under long-term continuous corn production decreased from the 10 to 20 mg/L range to less than 5 mg/L after seven years of cover crop use. Cover crops appeared to increase corn yields under adverse growing season conditions, but limited residual nitrate availability during the growing season relative to winter-fallow settings. Cover crop growth was generally N limited, suggesting that increased N inputs would have little effect on nitrate leaching, but would increase cover crop contributions to soil carbon pools.},

  abstract = {How farming systems supply sufficient nitrogen (N) for high yields but with reduced N losses is a central challenge for reducing the tradeoffs often associated with N cycling in agriculture. Variability in soil organic matter and management of organic farms across an agricultural landscape may yield insights for improving N cycling and for evaluating novel indicators of N availability. We assessed yields, plant-soil N cycling, and root expression of N metabolism genes across a representative set of organic fields growing Roma-type tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.) in an intensively-managed agricultural landscape in California, USA. The fields spanned a three-fold range of soil carbon (C) and N but had similar soil types, texture, and pH. Organic tomato yields ranged from 22.9 to 120.1 Mg ha-1 with a mean similar to the county average (86.1 Mg ha-1), which included mostly conventionally-grown tomatoes. Substantial variability in soil inorganic N concentrations, tomato N, and root gene expression indicated a range of possible tradeoffs between yields and potential for N losses across the fields. Fields showing evidence of tightly-coupled plant-soil N cycling, a desirable scenario in which high crop yields are supported by adequate N availability but low potential for N loss, had the highest total and labile soil C and N and received organic matter inputs with a range of N availability. In these fields, elevated expression of a key gene involved in root N assimilation, cytosolic glutamine synthetase GS1, confirmed that plant N assimilation was high even when inorganic N pools were low. Thus tightly-coupled N cycling occurred on several working organic farms. Novel combinations of N cycling indicators (i.e. inorganic N along with soil microbial activity and root gene expression for N assimilation) would support adaptive management for improved N cycling on organic as well as conventional farms, especially when plant-soil N cycling is rapid.},

  abstract = {Chamber-based estimates of soil-to-atnaosphere nitrous oxide (N2O)gas flux tend to underestimate actual emission rates due to inherently nonlinear time series data. In theory, this limitation can be minimized by adjusting measurement conditions to reduce nonlinearity and/or by using flux-calculation (FC) schemes that account for the so-called "chamber effect" The current study utilizes gas transport theory and stochastic analysis to evaluate accuracy and precision of N2O flux determinations under specific soil and chamber conditions. The analysis demonstrates that measures taken to increase the absolute accuracy of flux estimates, including shorter deployment times, larger chamber heights, and nonlinear FC schemes, will also increase the variance in flux estimates to an extent that depends on errors associated with sampling techniques and analytical instrument performance. These effects, in the absence of any actual variation in fluxes, can generate coefficients of variation ranging from 3 to 70\% depending on measurement conditions. It is also shown that nonlinear FC schemes are prone to generating positively skewed distributions. These effects decrease confidence in N2O flux estimates and inhibit the detection of differences arising from experimental factors. In general, a linear FC scheme will be more likely to detect relative differences in fluxes, although less accurate in absolute terms than nonlinear schemes. The techniques described here have been codified into an accessible spreadsheet-based tool for evaluating accuracy and precision trade-offs under specific measurement conditions.},

A survey of denitrifying enzyme content of various habitats is presented which indicates a role of carbon and oxygen, but not nitrate, in affecting denitrifier populations. It is suggested that organic carbon is more important than oxygen status in determining denitrifying enzyme content of habitats. In low oxygen environments, denitrifiers compete with organisms that dissimilate nitrate to ammonium, a process which conserves nitrogen. The energetic and kinetic parameters that affect this competition are evaluated. The latter is examined using Michaelis-Menten theoretical models by varying Vmax, Km, and So (substrate concentration) for the two competing populations. The outcome predicted by these models is presented and discussed in relation to previous data on population densities and Km values for representatives of these competing groups. These models suggest the conditions required to achieve changes in partitioning between the two fates of nitrate. These considerations are important if one is to be able to evaluate and successfully "manage" the fate of nitrate in any habitat.},

  volume = {19},
  issn = {14622920},
  abstract = {While there is no doubt that biogenic methane production in the Arctic is an important aspect of global methane emissions, the relative roles of microbial community characteristics and soil environmental conditions in controlling Arctic methane emissions remains uncertain. Here, relevant methane-cycling microbial groups were investigated at two remote Arctic sites with respect to soil potential methane production (PMP). Percent abundances of methanogens and iron-reducing bacteria correlated with increased PMP, while methanotrophs correlated with decreased PMP. Interestingly, {$\alpha$}-diversity of the methanogens was positively correlated with PMP, while {$\beta$}-diversity was unrelated to PMP. The {$\beta$}-diversity of the entire microbial community, however, was related to PMP. Shannon diversity was a better correlate of PMP than Simpson diversity across analyses, while rarefied species richness was a weak correlate of PMP. These results demonstrate the following: first, soil pH and microbial community structure both probably control methane production in Arctic soils. Second, there may be high functional redundancy in the methanogens with regard to methane production. Third, iron-reducing bacteria co-occur with methanogens in Arctic soils, and iron-reduction-mediated effects on methanogenesis may be controlled by {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-diversity. And finally, species evenness and rare species abundances may be driving relationships between microbial groups, influencing Arctic methane production.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to quantify N2O release from temperate grassland receiving different forms of N, and to assess the importance of controlling variables in the environment. In 2002 and 2003 three organic manures (sewage sludge pellets, poultry manure and cattle slurry) and two mineral fertilisers (NH4NO3 and urea) were applied to grassland in SE Scotland. All plots except the control received N fertilisers at a rate of 300 kg available N ha-1 a-1 (available N includes NO3 -, NH4 + and urea). Fluxes of N2O were measured using static chambers. Losses of N2O from plots receiving mineral fertiliser were short-lived with a peak value of 388 g N2O-N ha-1 day-1 from NH4NO3. Release of N2O from manure treatments however extended over a longer period and was greater in magnitude. Highest emissions were measured from sewage sludge treatments with a peak value of 3488 g N2O-N ha-1 day-1 and 26 times higher cumulative loss compared to the NH4NO3 treatment in 2002. A residual effect on N2O losses was observed from sewage sludge treatments in 2004 when the plots did not receive any fertiliser. There were considerable variations in fluxes between the years, which could be linked to differences in rainfall and temperature. The type of N applied affected the influence of these factors on N2O emissions. The amount of rainfall several days after the N application did not affect N2O fluxes on NH4NO3 treatments. However, in the sewage treated plots increased correlation coefficients were calculated when rainfall amounts over a longer period of time (up to 20 days) were included. A synergistic effect of rainfall and temperature on N2O fluxes could be observed on all treatments. A significant correlation between N2O fluxes and mineral soil N (NO3 - and NH4 +) was observed when soil water content was not limiting (r2 = 67\%, p  0.05). Gradual decomposition of organic material led to mineralization and nitrification of residual organic matter and hence to a prolonged accumulation of soil NO3 - on manure plots. Nitrate accumulation was greater in the dry year 2003 due to reduced leaching and decreased N2O loss. Most NH4 + was retained in the 0-10 cm layer and only NO3 - moved into the lower soil layer. The organic manure treatments did not result in increased grass productivity but did result in higher contents of soil mineral N (NH4 + and NO3 -), increased soil and plant total N content and resulted in an overall higher loss of N2O compared to mineral fertilisers. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Current numerical approaches then primarily emphasise the importance of microbe\textendash{}environment interactions and physiology as controls on biogeochemical cycles. Decidedly less attention has been paid to under-standing control exerted by community dynamics and biotic interactions. Yet a rich literature of theoretical and empirical contributions highlights the importance of considering how variation in microbial population ecology, especially biotic interactions, is related to variation in key biogeo-chemical processes like soil carbon formation. We demonstrate how a population and community ecology perspective can be used to (1) understand the impact of microbial communities on biogeo-chemical cycles and (2) reframe current theory and models to include more detailed microbial ecology. Through a series of simulations we illustrate how density dependence and key biotic interactions, such as competition and predation, can determine the degree to which microbes regulate soil biogeochemical cycles. The ecological perspective and model simulations we present lay the foundation for developing empirical research and complementary models that explore the diversity of ecological mechanisms that operate in microbial communities to regulate biogeochemical processes.},

Understanding of the ecological consequences of this conversion are limited by poor knowledge of how soil microorganisms respond. We analyzed the response of soil bacteria to conversion from primary rain forest to oil palm plantation and regenerating logged forest in Malaysia. Bacterial diversity increased by approximately 20\% with conversion to oil palm because of higher pH due to liming by plantation managers. Phylogenetic clustering indicated that bacterial communities were determined by environmental filtering. Regenerating logged forests did not have significantly different soil chemistry, which did not correspond with significant differences in bacterial richness, diversity, or the relative abundances of particular taxa. However, there were significant differences in the structure of bacterial community networks between regenerating logged forests and primary forests, highlighting previously unobserved effects of these two land uses. Network analysis highlighted taxa that are potentially central to bacterial networks, but have low relative abundances, suggesting that these rare taxa could play an ecological role and therefore warrant further research.},

  abstract = {Root-derived carbon (C) is preferentially retained in soil compared to aboveground C inputs. Microbial communities in the rhizosphere are crucial to nutrient and organic matter cycling within agroecosystems. The overall aim of this study was to investigate the impacts of crop management on microbial community structure and processing of rhizodeposit-C within microenvironments of two soil zones, the rhizosphere versus non-rhizosphere. New root-C (C-new) from C-13-labeled hairy vetch (Vicia dasycarpa) plants were traced into phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) within microaggregate (53-250 mu m) and silt-and-clay ( 53 mu m) microenvironments in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil during the cover crop growing season in long-term conventional (annual synthetic fertilizer applications), low-input (synthetic fertilizer and cover crop applied in alternating years), and organic (annual composted manure and cover crop additions) maize-tomato systems (Zea mays L.- Lycopersicum esculentum L.). Among the three cropping systems, the composition of the microbial communities processing root-derived C were similar, which implied that the cropping systems maintained diverse microbial communities that were capable of utilizing similar C substrates despite receiving different long-term nutrient inputs. Relative distributions of root-derived PLFA-C (C-13 mol\%) in the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere were not significantly different, thereby suggesting that the structure of the microbial community utilizing new root-C in the rhizosphere- and non-rhizosphere microenvironments were similar. However, total PLFA biomass was four times greater, and root-derived PLFA-C in both soil microenvironments were approximately 10 times greater in the rhizosphere than in the non-rhizosphere. Although no microbial group dominated the processing of C-new in the microenvironments of the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere, we found that the microbial community of the silt-and-clay in the rhizosphere played a different role in the cycling of C-new compared to communities in the rhizosphere microaggregates and those in the silt-and-clay and microaggregates of the non-rhizosphere. Our results confirm that rhizodeposition plays an important role in the greater contribution of root-C than residue-C to SOM stabilization. This study also showed that microbial communities assimilating rhizodeposit-C are sensitive to their microenvironment (i.e., microaggregates versus silt-and-clay particles); nevertheless, differences in long-term crop management did not lead to differences in the capacity of the microbial communities to utilize active cover crop root-C substrates.},

  issn = {1461023X},
  abstract = {Microbes are the unseen majority in soil and comprise a large portion of life's genetic diversity. Despite their abundance, the impact of soil microbes on ecosystem processes is still poorly understood. Here we explore the various roles that soil microbes play in terrestrial ecosystems with special emphasis on their contribution to plant productivity and diversity. Soil microbes are important regulators of plant productivity, especially in nutrient poor ecosystems where plant symbionts are responsible for the acquisition of limiting nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria are responsible for c. 5-20\% (grassland and savannah) to 80\% (temperate and boreal forests) of all nitrogen, and up to 75\% of phosphorus, that is acquired by plants annually. Free-living microbes also strongly regulate plant productivity, through the mineralization of, and competition for, nutrients that sustain plant productivity. Soil microbes, including microbial pathogens, are also important regulators of plant community dynamics and plant diversity, determining plant abundance and, in some cases, facilitating invasion by exotic plants. Conservative estimates suggest that c. 20 000 plant species are completely dependent on microbial symbionts for growth and survival pointing to the importance of soil microbes as regulators of plant species richness on Earth. Overall, this review shows that soil microbes must be considered as important drivers of plant diversity and productivity in terrestrial ecosystems.},

The vegetation pattern on diorite is characterized by closed Douglas fir-sclerophyll forests, whereas open, stunted stands of pines and other conifers appear on serpentine. Undergrowth in intermediate stites on serpentine shows an unusual development of a two-phase structure of grass and shrub patches, and in all sites on serpentine numerous endemic herb species occur. 3. Relatively few plant species occur on both diorite and serpentine, and the two floras are shown to be in marked contrast in representation of floristic regions. A means of expressing average range and direction of greater extent for a flora was devised. This shows the serpentine flora to be much more restricted in average extent and to have its greatest extent toward the south, in contrast to the diorite flora. 4. Evidence indicates that Siskiyou serpentine vegetation is climax, although affected by fires. 5. Serpentine vegetations appear in general to be characterized by apparent xeromorphism resulting from basic reduction of productivity, reduction of structure toward the lower strata, and dominance of conifers and especially pines, sclerophyllous shrubs, and grasses. As parts of ecosystems differing fundamentally in nutrient economy, vegetation patterns on serpentine and diorite differ in almost every respect which can be described or measured.},

Although a large proportion of genes were consistently regulated in both the stationary phase and biofilm cultures as opposed to the late exponential growth phase cultures, the global biofilm gene expression pattern was clearly distinct indicating that biofilms are not just surface attached cells in stationary phase. A large amount of the genes found to be biofilm specific were involved in adaptation to microaerophilic growth conditions, repression of type three secretion and production of extracellular matrix components. Additionally, we found many small RNAs to be differentially regulated most of them similarly in stationary phase cultures and biofilms. A qualitative analysis of the RNA-seq data revealed more than 3000 putative transcriptional start sites (TSS). By the use of rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'-RACE) we confirmed the presence of three different TSS associated with the pqsABCDE operon, two in the promoter of pqsA and one upstream of the second gene, pqsB. Taken together, this study reports the first transcriptome study on P. aeruginosa that employs RNA sequencing technology and provides insights into the quantitative and qualitative transcriptome including the expression of small RNAs in P. aeruginosa biofilms.},

Soil incubated in the laboratory at 60\% WFP supported maximum aerobic microbial activity as determined by CO2 production and O2 uptake. In the field, \% WFP of surface no-tillage soils (0-75 mm) at four U.S. locations averaged 62\% at time of sampling, whereas that for plowed soils was 44\%. This difference in \% WFP was reflected in 3.4 and 9.4 times greater CO2 and N2O production, respectively, from surface no-tillage soils over a 24-h period as compared to plowed soils. At a depth of 75 to 150 mm, \% WFP values increased in both no-tillage and plowed soils, averaging approximately 70\% for no tillage compared with 50 to 60\% for plowed soils. Production of CO2 in the plowed soils was enhanced by the increased \% WFP, resulting in little or no difference in CO2 production between tillage treatments. Nitrous oxide production, however, remained greater under no-tillage conditions. Substantially greater amounts of N2O were produced from the N-fertilized soils, regardless of tillage practice. Production of CO2 and N2O was primarily related to the \% WFP of tillage treatments although, in several instances, soil-water-soluble C and NO-3 levels were important as well. Calculations of relative aerobic microbial activity between no-tillage and plowed soils, based on differences in \% WFP relative to maximum activity at 60\%, indicated linear relationships for CO2 and N2O production between WFP values of 30 to 70\%. Below 60\% WFP, water limits microbial activity, but above 60\%, aerobic microbial activity decreases--apparently the result of reduced aeration.},

While fungi have been identified as a putative source of N2O, little is known about their production of this greenhouse gas. Here we investigated the N2O-producing ability of a collection of 207 fungal isolates. Seventy strains producing N2O in pure culture were identified. They were mostly species from the order Hypocreales order-particularly Fusarium oxysporum and Trichoderma spp.-and to a lesser extent species from the orders Eurotiales, Sordariales, and Chaetosphaeriales. The N2O (15)N site preference (SP) values of the fungal strains ranged from 15.8\textperthousand{} to 36.7\textperthousand, and we observed a significant taxa effect, with Penicillium strains displaying lower SP values than the other fungal genera. Inoculation of 15 N2O-producing strains into pre-sterilized arable, forest and grassland soils confirmed the ability of the strains to produce N2O in soil with a significant strain-by-soil effect. The copper-containing nitrite reductase gene (nirK) was amplified from 45 N2O-producing strains, and its genetic variability showed a strong congruence with the ITS phylogeny, indicating vertical inheritance of this trait.

  abstract = {Finding ways of reducing nitrate leaching in Northern Europe has become an extremely important task, especially under the projected climate changes that are expected to exacerbate the problem. To this end, two field experiments were established under temperate coastal climate conditions to evaluate the effect of tillage, straw retainment and cropping sequences, including cover crops, on nitrate leaching. The experiments were established in autumn 2002 on a loamy sand with 92gclaykg-1 and a sandy loam with 147gclaykg-1. The tillage treatments were stubble cultivation to 8-10cm or 3-4cm, direct drilling, or ploughing to 20cm. The hypothesis was that (i) decreasing soil tillage intensity would decrease leaching compared to ploughing, (ii) leaving straw in the field would decrease leaching compared to removing straw, and (iii) a spring/winter crop rotation with catch crops would be more efficient in reducing nitrate leaching than a winter crop rotation. Overall, we were not able to confirm the three hypotheses. The effect of soil tillage on leaching might be blurred because the studied crop rotations had a high proportion of winter crops and because catch crops were grown whenever the alternative would have been bare soil in autumn and winter. The spring/winter crop rotation with catch crops was not found to be more efficient in reducing nitrate leaching than the winter crop rotation. In contrast, in a single year the winter crop rotation showed significantly lower leaching than the spring/winter crop rotations, probably due to the spring/winter crop rotation including peas, which may be considered a high-risk crop. Our study highlights that management practices that improve biomass production throughout the year are crucial in order to tighten the nitrogen cycle and thereby reduce nitrate leaching. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of methane (CH4 ) emissions is of paramount importance because CH4 has 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and is currently the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas. Wetlands are the single largest natural CH4 source with median emissions from published studies of 164 Tg~yr(-1) , which is about a third of total global emissions. We provide a perspective on important new frontiers in obtaining a better understanding of CH4 dynamics in natural systems, with a focus on wetlands. One of the most exciting recent developments in this field is the attempt to integrate the different methodologies and spatial scales of biogeochemistry, molecular microbiology, and modeling, and thus this is a major focus of this review. Our specific objectives are to provide an up-to-date synthesis of estimates of global CH4 emissions from wetlands and other freshwater aquatic ecosystems, briefly summarize major biogeophysical controls over CH4 emissions from wetlands, suggest new frontiers in CH4 biogeochemistry, examine relationships between methanogen community structure and CH4 dynamics in situ, and to review the current generation of CH4 models. We highlight throughout some of the most pressing issues concerning global change and feedbacks on CH4 emissions from natural ecosystems. Major uncertainties in estimating current and future CH4 emissions from natural ecosystems include the following: (i) A number of important controls over CH4 production, consumption, and transport have not been, or are inadequately, incorporated into existing CH4 biogeochemistry models. (ii) Significant errors in regional and global emission estimates are derived from large spatial-scale extrapolations from highly heterogeneous and often poorly mapped wetland complexes. (iii) The limited number of observations of CH4 fluxes and their associated environmental variables loosely constrains the parameterization of process-based biogeochemistry models.},

  abstract = {To investigate the influence of plant residues decomposition on N 2O emission, laboratory incubations were carried out for a period of 21 days using urea and five plant residues with a wide range of C:N ratios from 8 to 118. Incorporation of plant residues enhanced N2O and CO 2 emissions. The two gas fluxes were significantly correlated (R 2=0.775, p0.001). Cumulative emissions of N2O and CO2 were negatively correlated with the C:N ratio in plant residues (R2=0.783 and 0.986 for N2O, and 0.854 for CO2, respectively). A negative relationship between the N2O-N/NO 3--N ratio and the C:N ratio was observed (R 2=0.867) when residue plus urea was added. We calculated the changes in dissolved organic C (DOC) and the relevant changes in N2O emission. The incorporation of residues increased DOC when compared with the control, while the incorporation of residue plus urea decreased DOC. Cumulative emissions of N2O and CO2 were positively correlated with DOC concentration measured at the end of the incubation. In addition, the N 2O emission fraction, defined as N2O-N emissions per unit N input, was not found to be a constant for either residue-N or urea-N amendment but dependent on C:N ratio when plant residue was incorporated. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  volume = {4},
  issn = {1741-7007},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The view that gene flow between related animal species is rare and evolutionarily unimportant largely antedates sensitive molecular techniques. Here we use DNA sequencing to investigate a pair of morphologically and ecologically divergent, non-sibling butterfly species, Heliconius cydno and H. melpomene (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae), whose distributions overlap in Central and Northwestern South America. RESULTS: In these taxa, we sequenced 30-45 haplotypes per locus of a mitochondrial region containing the genes for cytochrome oxidase subunits I and II (CoI/CoII), and intron-spanning fragments of three unlinked nuclear loci: triose-phosphate isomerase (Tpi), mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (Mpi) and cubitus interruptus (Ci) genes. A fifth gene, dopa decarboxylase (Ddc) produced sequence data likely to be from different duplicate loci in some of the taxa, and so was excluded. Mitochondrial and Tpi genealogies are consistent with reciprocal monophyly, whereas sympatric populations of the species in Panama share identical or similar Mpi and Ci haplotypes, giving rise to genealogical polyphyly at the species level despite evidence for rapid sequence divergence at these genes between geographic races of H. melpomene. CONCLUSION: Recent transfer of Mpi haplotypes between species is strongly supported, but there is no evidence for introgression at the other three loci. Our results demonstrate that the boundaries between animal species can remain selectively porous to gene flow long after speciation, and that introgression, even between non-sibling species, can be an important factor in animal evolution. Interspecific gene flow is demonstrated here for the first time in Heliconius and may provide a route for the transfer of switch-gene adaptations for M{\"u}llerian mimicry. The results also forcefully demonstrate how reliance on a single locus may give an erroneous picture of the overall genealogical history of speciation and gene flow.},

  abstract = {Chronosequences of ???250 to ???130 years were established on two late Holocene glacier forelands in the Jotunheimen region of southern Norway. Patterned features occurring within chronologically established time units were studied. Young patterned features, forming ???10-20 years after deglaciation, are frost active. Vegetation cover is minimal within the young patterned features, consisting of bryophytes/organic crusts. Soil development within patterned ground is also minimal/absent because frost action retards horizonization. With time and distance from the glaciated ice margin, frost activity declines within the patterned features, suggesting that a thin, active "periglacial zone" exists near the ice margin. Initially, frost activity decreases at the borders of the features with the centers stabilizing later in time. This results in fine-scale soil heterogeneity and variations of soil development. Fine-scale pedogenic development is first encountered at the borders of patterned ground that has developed on terrain exposed since the ???1930s, yet soil development is predominantly absent at the centers of patterned ground. With time and distance from the ice margin, frost activity declines and allows patterned features to homogenize from border to center positions in regard to soil characteristics. Across the chronosequences, soils within patterned features pedogenically follow previous soil chronosequence studies, evolving from USDA classifications of Entisols into Inceptisols. Frost disturbance within patterned ground, however, produces a lag effect, that results in longer periods of time for pedogenesis to occur and thinner soils than that of the surrounding terrain. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  title = {Soil-Carbon Response to Warming Dependent on Microbial Physiology},
  volume = {3},
  issn = {17520894},
  abstract = {Most ecosystem models predict that climate warming will stimulate microbial decomposition of soil carbon, producing a positive feedback to rising global temperatures(1,2). Although field experiments document an initial increase in the loss of CO2 from soils in response to warming, in line with these predictions, the carbon dioxide loss from soils tends to decline to control levels within a few years(3-5). This attenuation response could result from changes in microbial physiological properties with increasing temperature, such as a decline in the fraction of assimilated carbon that is allocated to growth, termed carbon-use efficiency(6). Here we explore these mechanisms using a microbial-enzyme model to simulate the responses of soil carbon to warming by 5 degrees C. We find that declines in microbial biomass and degradative enzymes can explain the observed attenuation of soil-carbon emissions in response to warming. Specifically, reduced carbon-use efficiency limits the biomass of microbial decomposers and mitigates the loss of soil carbon. However, microbial adaptation or a change in microbial communities could lead to an upward adjustment of the efficiency of carbon use, counteracting the decline in microbial biomass and accelerating soil-carbon loss. We conclude that the soil-carbon response to climate warming depends on the efficiency of soil microbes in using carbon.},

  abstract = {For the last 30 years, static (or `non-steady state') chambers have been most commonly used method for measuring N2O fluxes from agricultural soils. The main advantages of this technique are that it is relatively inexpensive, versatile in the field, and the technology is very easy to adopt. Consequently, much of the knowledge and understanding of N2O emissions that underpins the estimation of national emission inventories from agricultural soils and efficacies of potential mitigation practices is based on N2O chamber measurements. More than 95\% of the thousands of published N2O emission studies used chamber methodologies \textendash{} in particular, non-flow-through, non-steady-state (NSS) chambers. Non-steady-state chambers rely on the accumulation of N2O within an open-bottomed chamber placed on the soil surface. Headspace samples are usually taken once on each sampling day and analysed in the laboratory using gas chromatography to estimate the daily N2O flux of each chamber. Flux measurements are then made from a given number of chambers over a given time period, and a given sampling frequency, to determine spatially and temporally integrated N2O emissions. The key aspects of chamber methodologies all have the potential to bias results or bias third-party interpretation of those results, and therefore limit inter-study comparisons and assessment of the reliability and uncertainty associated with the results. The international science community increasingly recognises the need for standardised guidelines on the use of chambers \textendash{} and associated data reporting \textendash{} for measuring N2O emissions from agricultural soils. In 2011/12, the New Zealand Government, in support of the objectives of the Livestock Research Group of the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases, funded an international collaboration to progress the development of guidelines and recommendations. At an initial workshop in New Zealand in May 2011, leading experts from Alliance member countries reviewed the current state of understanding of N2O chamber methodologies, and developed the outlines for this guideline document. Since then, researchers from around the world have been working together to write the chapters for the different steps in producing and reporting N2O flux data from the use of chambers. This document details the current state of knowledge of N2O chamber methodologies and provides guidelines and recommendations for their use. In developing the guidelines, each chapter covers one of the key aspects \textendash{} including design, deployment, air sample collection, storage and sample analysis, data analysis and data reporting \textendash{}with additional chapters on automated systems and Health and Safety. Each chapter outlines: i) agreed minimum standards, ii) site or system specific requirements and iii) evolving standards. The minimum requirements and evolving standards are summarised here, and at the start of each chapter. For site- or system-specific requirements please refer to the individual chapters. The guidelines define minimum requirements, but are not highly prescriptive. They aim to provide practitioners with information on best practice and factors that need to be considered in design and operation of N2O flux measurement programmes. Areas where there is no current consensus are described as `evolving issues'. A major discussion point that emerged was the difficulty of having to balance limited resources between carefully measuring individual fluxes, versus increasing the number of chambers and/or sampling occasions to account for spatial and temporal variability. Understanding the size of the uncertainties of each step of the chamber measurement approach, and their impact on relative uncertainty of estimated cumulative emissions and emission factors, will be of critical importance for balancing (limited) resources to achieve the best possible (most accurate) results.},

Circulation of anthropogenic Nr in Earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere has a wide variety of consequences, which are magnified with time as Nr moves along its biogeochemical pathway. The same atom of Nr can cause multiple effects in the atmosphere, in terrestrial ecosystems, in freshwater and marine systems, and on human health. We call this sequence of effects the nitrogen cascade. As the cascade progresses, the origin of Nr becomes unimportant. Reactive nitrogen does not cascade at the same rate through all environmental systems; some systems have the ability to accumulate Nr, which leads to lag times in the continuation of the cascade. These lags slow the cascade and result in Nr accumulation in certain reservoirs, which in turn can enhance the effects of Nr on that environment. The only way to eliminate Nr accumulation and stop the cascade is to convert Nr back to nonreactive N2.},

The impact of NT/RT on N2O emissions, however, has been variable with both increases and decreases in emissions reported. Herein, we quantitatively synthesize studies on the short- and long-term impact of NT/RT on N2O emissions in humid and dry climatic zones with emissions expressed on both an area- and crop yield-scaled basis. A meta-analysis was conducted on 239 direct comparisons between conventional tillage (CT) and NT/RT. In contrast to earlier studies, averaged across all comparisons, NT/RT did not alter N2O emissions compared with CT. However, NT/RT significantly reduced N2O emissions in experiments 10 years, especially in dry climates. No significant correlation was found between soil texture and the effect of NT/RT on N2O emissions. When fertilizer-N was placed at {$\geq$}5 cm depth, NT/RT significantly reduced area-scaled N2O emissions, in particular under humid climatic conditions. Compared to CT under dry climatic conditions, yield-scaled N2O increased significantly (57\%) when NT/RT was implemented 10 years, but decreased significantly (27\%) after {$\geq$}10 years of NT/RT. There was a significant decrease in yield-scaled N2O emissions in humid climates when fertilizer-N was placed at {$\geq$}5 cm depth. Therefore, in humid climates, deep placement of fertilizer-N is recommended when implementing NT/RT. In addition, NT/RT practices need to be sustained for a prolonged time, particularly in dry climates, to become an effective mitigation strategy for reducing N2O emissions.},

  abstract = {Stable isotope addition experiments seeking to trace the denitrification of combined forms of nitrogen (N) to gaseous N2 in aquatic environments typically need to measure the stable isotope ratio of dissolved nitrogen gas. This measurement presents challenges because of the potential for contamination of samples by N in air, and because field experiments conducted in situ often do not produce a marked enrichment in the isotope ratio of the N2 pool. Field experiments also require numerous samples, sometimes processed under arduous conditions, and thus methods have to be convenient and low in cost. This paper describes the methods for sampling and measurement of the N isotope ratio of dissolved nitrogen that were developed for the isotope addition experiments in the Lotic Intersite Nitrogen Experiment (LINX), a cross-site study examining N biogeochemistry in headwater streams. Headspace equilibration was performed in the field and gas samples were stored in reevacuated glass vials (Exetainers). Samples were processed and stored underwater to minimize the potential for contamination of samples by air. Isotope ratios were measured using a gas chromatograph interfaced to the isotope ratio mass spectrometer and equipped with a custom sample entry system.},

  volume = {17},
  issn = {10510761},
  abstract = {Bioenergy cropping systems could help offset greenhouse gas emissions, but quantifying that offset is complex. Bioenergy crops offset carbon dioxide emissions by converting atmospheric CO2 to organic C in crop biomass and soil, but they also emit nitrous oxide and vary in their effects on soil oxidation of methane. Growing the crops requires energy (e.g., to operate farm machinery, produce inputs such as fertilizer) and so does converting the harvested product to usable fuels (feedstock conversion efficiency). The objective of this study was to quantify all these factors to determine the net effect of several bioenergy cropping systems on greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. We used the DAYCENT biogeochemistry model to assess soil GHG fluxes and biomass yields for corn, soybean, alfalfa, hybrid poplar, reed canarygrass, and switchgrass as bioenergy crops in Pennsylvania, USA. DAYCENT results were combined with estimates of fossil fuels used to provide farm inputs and operate agricultural machinery and fossil-fuel offsets from biomass yields to calculate net GHG fluxes for each cropping system considered. Displaced fossil fuel was the largest GHG sink, followed by soil carbon sequestration. N20 emissions were the largest GHG source. All cropping systems considered provided net GHG sinks, even when soil C was assumed to reach a new steady state and C sequestration in soil was not counted. Hybrid poplar and switchgrass provided the largest net GHG sinks, 200 g CO2e-C x m(-2) x yr(-1) for biomass conversion to ethanol, and 400 g CO2e-C x m(-2) x yr(-1) for biomass gasification for electricity generation. Compared with the life cycle of gasoline and diesel, ethanol and biodiesel from corn rotations reduced GHG emissions by approximately 40\%, reed canarygrass by approximately 85\%, and switchgrass and hybrid poplar by approximately 115\%.},

Two approaches have been successfully applied to agricultural systems research: 1) field station experiments where simulated cropping systems are established in replicated plots and 2) studies of intact agroecosystems using commercial farms as study sites. These two approaches have complementary strengths and limitations and have made significant contributions to our understanding of ecological processes in agricultural systems.

The identification of litter affinity effects, whereby decomposition is accelerated in its home environment (home-field advantage, HFA), highlights the importance of plant\textendash{}soil interactions that have consequences for biogeochemical cycling. While not universal, these affinity effects have been identified in a range of ecosystems, particularly in forests without disturbance. The optimization of the local decomposer community to degrade a particular combination of litter traits is the most oft-cited explanation for HFA effects, but the ways in which this specialized community can develop are only beginning to be understood. We explore ways in which HFA, or more broadly litter affinity effects, could arise in terrestrial ecosystems. Plant\textendash{}herbivore interactions, microbial symbiosis, legacies from phyllo-sphere communities and attractors of specific soil fauna could contribute to spatially defined affinity effects for litter decomposition. Pyrosequencing soil communities and functional linkages of soil fauna provide great promise in advancing our mechanistic understanding of these interactions, and could lead to a greater appreciation of the role of litter\textendash{}decomposer affinity in the maintenance of soil functional diversity.},

Th e technique is based on previously established gas transport theory and has been simplifi ed to facilitate application while preserving the fundamental physical relationships. Th e method avoids the use of nonlinear regression but requires knowledge of soil properties including texture, bulk density, water content, temperature, and pH. Two options are presented: a numerical technique which is easily adapted to spreadsheet application, and a graphical method requiring minimal calculation. In both cases, the magnitude of theoretical fl ux underestimation (TFU) is determined, taking into account eff ects of chamber geometry and deployment time, the fl ux-calculation scheme, and properties of the soil and gas under consideration. Application to actual data and recent studies confi rmed that TFU can vary widely within and across sites. Th e analysis also revealed a highly linear correlation between soil water content and TFU, suggesting that previously observed relationships between water content and trace gas fl ux may in part refl ect artifacts of chamber methodology. Th e method described here provides a practical means of improving the absolute accuracy of fl ux estimates and normalizing data obtained using diff erent chamber designs in diff erent soils.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract. Species with relatively narrow niches, such as plants restricted (endemic) to particular soils, may be especially vulnerable to extinction under a changing climate due to the enhanced difficulty they face in migrating to suitable new sites. To test for community-level effects of climate change, and to compare such effects in a highly endemic-rich flora on unproductive serpentine soils vs. the flora of normal (diorite) soils, in 2007 we resampled as closely as possible 108 sites originally studied by ecologist Robert H. Whittaker from 1949 to 1951 in the Siskiyou Mountains of southern Oregon, USA. We found sharp declines in herb cover and richness on both serpentine and diorite soils. Declines were strongest in species of northern biogeographic affinity, species endemic to the region (in serpentine communities only), and species endemic to serpentine soils. Consistent with climatic warming, herb communities have shifted from 1949-1951 to 2007 to more closely resemble communities found on xeric (warm, dry) south-facing slopes. The changes found in the Siskiyou herb flora suggest that biotas rich in narrowly distributed endemics may be particularly susceptible to the effects of a warming climate.},

  title = {Structure, Function and Diversity of the Healthy Human Microbiome},
  volume = {486},
  abstract = {Studies of the human microbiome have revealed that even healthy individuals differ remarkably in the microbes that occupy habitats such as the gut, skin and vagina. Much of this diversity remains unexplained, although diet, environment, host genetics and early microbial exposure have all been implicated. Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analysed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats so far. We found the diversity and abundance of each habitat's signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals. The project encountered an estimated 81\textendash{}99\% of the genera, enzyme families and community configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome. Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background proved to be one of the strongest associations of both pathways and microbes with clinical metadata. These results thus delineate the range of structural and functional configurations normal in the microbial communities of a healthy population, enabling future characterization of the epidemiology, ecology and translational applications of the human microbiome. A total of 4,788 specimens from 242 screened and phenotyped adults 1 (129 males, 113 females) were available for this study, representing the majority of the target Human Microbiome Project (HMP) cohort of 300 individuals. Adult subjects lacking evidence of disease were recruited based on a lengthy list of exclusion criteria; we will refer to them here as 'healthy', as defined by the consortium clinical sampling criteria (K. Aagaard et al., manuscript submitted). Women were sampled at 18 body habitats, men at 15 (excluding three vaginal sites), distributed among five major body areas. Nine specimens were collected from the oral cavity and oropharynx: saliva; buccal mucosa (cheek), keratinized gingiva (gums), palate, tonsils, throat and tongue soft tissues, and supra-and subgingival dental plaque (tooth biofilm above and below the gum). Four skin specimens were collected from the two retroauricular creases (behind each ear) and the two antecubital fossae (inner elbows), and one specimen for the anterior nares (nostrils). A self-collected stool specimen represented the micro-biota of the lower gastrointestinal tract, and three vaginal specimens were collected from the vaginal introitus, midpoint and posterior fornix. To evaluate within-subject stability of the microbiome, 131 individuals in these data were sampled at an additional time point (mean 219 days and s.d. 69 days after first sampling, range 35\textendash{}404 days). After quality control, these specimens were used for 16S rRNA gene analysis via 454 pyrosequencing (abbreviated henceforth as 16S profil-ing, mean 5,408 and s.d. 4,605 filtered sequences per sample); to assess function, 681 samples were sequenced using paired-end Illumina shotgun metagenomic reads (mean 2.9 gigabases (Gb) and s.d. 2.1 Gb per sample) 1},

  abstract = {Nitrification and denitrification processes are crucial to plant nutrient availability, eutrophication and greenhouse gas production both locally and globally. Unravelling the major environmental predictors for nitrification and denitrification is thus pivotal in order to understand and model environmental nitrogen (N) cycling. Here, we sampled five plant community types characteristic of interior Alaska, including black spruce, bog birch, tussock grass and two fens. We assessed abundance of functional genes affiliated with nitrification (bacterial and archaeal amoA) and denitrification (nirK/S and nosZ) using qPCR, soil characteristics, potential nitrification and denitrification rates (PNR and PDR) and gross mineralization rates. The main chemical and biological predictors for PNR and PDR were assigned through path analysis. The potential N cycling rates varied dramatically between sites, from some of the highest (in fens) to some of the lowest (in black spruce) measured globally. Based on path analysis, functional gene abundances were the most important variables to predict potential rates. PNR was best explained by bacterial amoA gene abundance followed by ammonium content, whereas PDR was best explained directly by nosZ gene abundance and indirectly by nirK/S gene abundance and nitrate. Hence, functional gene abundance is a valuable index that integrates recent environmental history and recent process activity, and therefore is a good predictor of potential rates. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of the relative importance of different biological and chemical factors in driving the potential for nitrification and denitrification across terrestrial ecosystems.},

  abstract = {For centuries ecologists have studied how the diversity and functional traits of plant and animal communities vary across biomes. In contrast, we have only just begun exploring similar questions for soil microbial communities despite soil microbes being the dominant engines of biogeochemical cycles and a major pool of living biomass in terrestrial ecosystems. We used metagenomic sequencing to compare the composition and functional attributes of 16 soil microbial communities collected from cold deserts, hot deserts, forests, grasslands, and tundra. Those communities found in plant-free cold desert soils typically had the lowest levels of functional diversity (diversity of protein-coding gene categories) and the lowest levels of phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity. Across all soils, functional beta diversity was strongly correlated with taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity; the desert microbial communities were clearly distinct from the nondesert communities regardless of the metric used. The desert communities had higher relative abundances of genes associated with osmoregulation and dormancy, but lower relative abundances of genes associated with nutrient cycling and the catabolism of plant-derived organic compounds. Antibiotic resistance genes were consistently threefold less abundant in the desert soils than in the nondesert soils, suggesting that abiotic conditions, not competitive interactions, are more important in shaping the desert microbial communities. As the most comprehensive survey of soil taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity to date, this study demonstrates that metagenomic approaches can be used to build a predictive understanding of how microbial diversity and function vary across terrestrial biomes.},

Using EBA, Si was identified most commonly around the base of trichomes and along the leaf margins. The ICP-OES processing and analysis for Si using sodium hydroxide ( NaOH) resulted in damaged torches and microwavable Teflon (R) vessels that required expensive replacement at the end of each run, but this was not the case in the colorimetric method or with a potassium hydroxide (KOH)-based matrix in the ICP-OES. The results of these analyses suggest there is agreement between quantification methods, and EBA has a lower detection limit of about 300 mg kg(-1) dry weight of Si. Several new floriculture species (zinnia, impatiens, verbena, and calibrachoa) were identified that take up and accumulate Si in significant concentrations.},

  abstract = {The process by which species evolve can be illuminated by investigating barriers that limit gene flow between taxa. Recent radiations, such as Heliconius butterflies, offer the opportunity to compare isolation between pairs of taxa at different stages of ecological, geographic and phylogenetic divergence. We carry out a comparative analysis of existing and novel data in order to quantify the strength and direction of isolating barriers within a well-studied clade of Heliconius. Our results highlight that increased divergence is associated with the accumulation of stronger and more numerous barriers to gene flow. Wing pattern is both under natural selection for M{\"u}llerian mimicry and involved in mate choice, and therefore underlies several isolating barriers. However, pairs which share a similar wing pattern, also display strong reproductive isolation mediated by traits other than wing pattern. This suggests that, while wing pattern is a key factor for early stages of divergence, it is not essential at a higher level. Additional factors including habitat isolation, hybrid sterility and chemically-mediated mate choice are associated with complete speciation. Therefore, although most previous work has emphasised the role of wing pattern, our comparative results highlight that speciation is a multidimensional process, whose completion is stabilized by many factors.},

  abstract = {The establishment of cover crops, in relay, to minimise soil erosion, improve soil physical condition and provide a main-season crop in rotation with potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) is a recommended agronomic practice in Atlantic Canada. This is usually achieved by seeding winter rye (Secale cereale L.) or winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) immediately after potato harvest for ground cover followed, the next spring, by inter-seeding an annual or biennial forage crop by drilling. Spring drill seeding can, however, be delayed or prevented by wet ground conditions, thus, making broadcast seeding a considered alternative. This study examined, therefore, the comparative merits of spring broadcast seeding and drill seeding of two adapted forages, Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), into a standing crop of fall-seeded winter rye or winter wheat. Crop performance was evaluated, using meter-square quadrats, as ground coverage and grain yield (of cereals). Soil compaction, evaluated as shear strength in the 0-15 cm layer (avoiding wheel tracks) of a fine sandy loam (Orthic Podzol), was greater after drill seeding than after broadcast seeding by a factor of 7.2\% and was attributed to the greater ground-contact mass of the drill seeder. The forage crops provided 5.5\% more ground coverage with drill seeding than with broadcast seeding. However, seeding method had no effect on the cereal host crops' ground coverage or grain yield. Ryegrass coverage was 123\% of red clover coverage and winter rye coverage was 176\% of winter wheat coverage. Forage coverage, in this study, suffered no setback because of the greater soil compaction associated with drill seeding. However, soils are subject to greater compaction under wetter conditions, thus, broadcast seeding is expected to be a better option, the wetter the spring.},

  volume = {29},
  issn = {13652435},
  abstract = {One of the most pervasive concepts in the study of community assembly is the metaphor of the environmental filter, which refers to abiotic factors that prevent the establishment or persistence of species in a particular location. The metaphor has its origins in the study of community change during succession and in plant community dynamics, although it has gained considerable attention recently as part of a surge of interest in functional trait and phylogenetic-based approaches to the study of communities. While the filtering metaphor has clear utility in some circumstances, it has been challenging to reconcile the environmental filtering concept with recent developments in ecological theory related to species coexistence. These advances suggest that the evidence used in many studies to assess environmental filtering is insufficient to distinguish filtering from the outcome of biotic interactions. We re-examine the environmental filtering metaphor from the perspective of coexistence theory. In an effort to move the discussion forward, we present a simple framework for considering the role of the environment in shaping community membership, review the literature to document the evidence typically used in environmental filtering studies and highlight research challenges to address in coming years. The current usage of the environmental filtering term in empirical studies likely overstates the role abiotic tolerances play in shaping community structure. We recommend that the term `environmental filtering' only be used to refer to cases where the abiotic environment prevents establishment or persistence in the absence of biotic interactions, although only 15\% of the studies in our review presented such evidence. Finally, we urge community ecologists to consider additional mechanisms aside from environmental filtering by which the abiotic environment can shape community pattern.},

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from denitrification in agricultural soils often increases with N fertilizer and soil nitrate (NO 3) concentrations. Overwintering cover crops in cereal rotations can decrease soil NO3 concentrations and may decrease N2O emissions. However, mineralizable C availability can be a more important control on N2O emission than NO3 concentration in fertilized soils, and cover crop residue provides mineralizable C input. We measured the effect of a winter rye (Secale c{\'e}r{\'e}ale L.) cover crop on soil N2O emissions from a maize (Zea mays L.) cropping system treated with banded N fertilizer at three rates (0, 135, and 225 kg N ha-1) in Iowa. In addition, we conducted laboratory incubations to determine if potential N2O emissions were limited by mineralizable C or NO3 at these N rates. The rye cover crop decreased soil NO3 concentrations at all N rates. Although the cover crop decreased N2O emissions when no N fertilizer was applied, it increased N2O emissions at an N rate near the economic optimum. In laboratory incubations, N2O emissions from soils from fertilizer bands did not increase with added NO3, but did increase with added glucose. These results show that mineralizable C availability can control N2O emissions, indicating that C from cover crop residue increased N2O emissions from fertilizer band soils in the field. Mineralizable C availability should be considered in future evaluations of cover crop effects on N2O emissions, especially as cover crops are evaluated as a strategy to mitigate agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. \textcopyright{} Soil Science Society of America, All rights reserved.},

We used the highly parallel microarray technology GeoChip 4.0, which contains 83 992 probes specific for genes linked nutrient cycling and other processes, to evaluate how the diversity, abundance and similarity of the targeted genes responded to forest-to-pasture conversion. We also evaluated whether these parameters were reestablished with secondary forest growth. A spatially nested scheme was employed to sample a primary forest, two pastures (6 and 38 years old) and a secondary forest. Both pastures had significantly lower microbial functional genes richness and diversity when compared to the primary forest. Gene composition and turnover were also significantly modified with land use change. Edaphic traits associated with soil acidity, iron availability, soil texture and organic matter concentration were correlated with these gene changes. Although primary and secondary forests showed similar functional gene richness and diversity, there were differences in gene composition and turnover, suggesting that community recovery was not complete in the secondary forest. Gene association analysis revealed that response to ecosystem conversion varied significantly across functional gene groups, with genes linked to carbon and nitrogen cycling mostly altered. This study indicates that diversity and abundance of numerous environmentally important genes respond to forest-to-pasture conversion and hence have the potential to affect the related processes at an ecosystem scale.},

  abstract = {A no one knows at the present time the kinds and frequencies of variant alleles present in natural populations of any organism, with the exception of certain S pointed out in the first paper of this series (HUBBY and LEWONTIN 1966), special classes of genes. For human populations we know a good deal about certain polymorphisms for blood cell antigens, serum proteins, and metabolic disorders of various kinds but we can hardly regard these, a priori, as typical of the genome as a whole. Clearly we need a method that will randomly sample the genome and detect a major proportion of the individual allelic substitutions that are segre- gating in a population. In our previous paper, we discussed a method for accom- plishing this end by means of a study of electrophoretic variants at a large number of loci and we showed that the variation picked up by this method behaves in a simple Mendelian fashion so that phenotypes can be equated to homozygous and heterozygous genotypes at single loci. It is the purpose of this second paper to show the results of an application of the method to a series of samples chosen from natural populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura. In particular, we will show that there is a considerable amount of genic variation segregating in all of the populations studied and that the real variation in these populations must be greater than we are able to demonstrate. This study does not make clear what balance of forces is responsible for the genetic variation observed, but it does make clear the kind and amount of varia- tion at the genic level that we need to explain. An exactly similar method has recently been applied by HARRIS (1966) for the enzymes of human blood. In a preliminary report on ten randomly chosen enzymes, HARRIS describes two as definitely polymorphic genetically and a third as phenotypically polymorphic but with insufficient genetic data so far. Clearly these methods are applicable to any organism of macroscopic dimensions.},

  issn = {0886-6236},
  abstract = {Isotopomer ratios of N2O (bulk nitrogen and oxygen isotope ratios, {$\delta$}15Nbulk and {$\delta$}18O, and intramolecular 15N site preference, SP) are useful parameters that characterize sources of this greenhouse gas and also provide insight into production and consumption mechanisms. We measured isotopomer ratios of N2O emitted from typical Japanese agricultural soils (Fluvisols and Andisols) planted with rice, wheat, soybean, and vegetables, and treated with synthetic (urea or ammonium) and organic (poultry manure) fertilizers. The results were analyzed using a previously reported isotopomeric N2O signature produced by nitrifying/denitrifying bacteria and a characteristic relationship between {$\delta$}15Nbulk and SP during N2O reduction by denitrifying bacteria. Relative contributions from nitrification (hydroxylamine oxidation) and denitrification (nitrite reduction) to gross N2O production deduced from the analysis depended on soil type and fertilizer. The contribution from nitrification was relatively high (40\%70\%) in Andisols amended with synthetic ammonium fertilizer, while denitrification was dominant (50\%90\%) in the same soils amended with poultry manure during the period when N2O production occurred in the surface layer. This information on production processes is in accordance with that obtained from flux/concentration analysis of N2O and soil inorganic nitrogen. However, isotopomer analysis further revealed that partial reduction of N2O was pronounced in high-bulk density, alluvial soil (Fluvisol) compared to low-bulk density, volcanic ash soil (Andisol), and that the observed difference in N2O flux between normal and pelleted manure could have resulted from a similar mechanism with different rates of gross production and gross consumption. The isotopomeric analysis is based on data from pure culture bacteria and would be improved by further studies on in situ biological processes in soils including those by fungi. When flux/concentration-weighted average isotopomer ratios of N2O from various fertilized soils were examined, linear correlations were found between {$\delta$}15Nbulk and {$\delta$}18O, and between SP and {$\delta$}15Nbulk. These relationships would be useful to parameterize isotopomer ratios of soil-emitted N2O for the modeling of the global N2O isotopomer budget. The results obtained in this study and those from previous firn/ice core studies confirm that the principal source of anthropogenic N2O is fertilized soils.},

  abstract = {Changes in precipitation in the Amazon Basin resulting from regional deforestation, global warming, and El Nin\texttildelow{}o events may affect emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitric oxide (NO) from soils. Changes in soil emissions of radiatively important gases could have feedback implications for regional and global climate. Here, we report the final results of a 5-year, large-scale (1 ha) throughfall exclusion experiment, followed by 1 year of recovery with natural throughfall, conducted in a mature evergreen forest near Santare\textasciiacute{}m, Brazil. The exclusion manipulation lowered annual N2O emissions in four out of five treatment years (a natural drought year being the exception), and then recovered during the first year after the drought treatment stopped. Similarly, consumption of atmospheric CH4 increased under drought treatment, except during a natural drought year, and it also recovered to pretreatment values during the first year that natural throughfall was permitted back on the plot. No treatment effect was detected for NO emissions during the first 3 treatment years, but NO emissions increased in the fourth year under the extremely dry conditions of the exclusion plot during a natural drought. Surprisingly, there was no treatment effect on soil CO2 efflux in any year. The drought treatment provoked significant tree mortality and reduced the allocation of C to stems, but allocation of C to foliage and roots were less affected. Taken together, these results suggest that the dominant effect of throughfall exclusion on soil processes during this 6-year period was on soil aeration conditions that transiently affected CH4, N2O, and NO production and consumption.},

  issn = {00380717},
  abstract = {The understanding of nitrogen (N) cycling in forest ecosystems has undergone a major shift in the past decade as molecular methods are being used to link microorganisms to key processes in soil. The analysis of the abundance and community structure of functional genes involved in the biogeochemical cycling of N in forest soils offers an approach to directly link microbial groups to soil characteristics and ecosystem processes. The majority of N entering ecosystems is biologically-derived from fixation of atmospheric N2. Molecular studies of N-fixation use the nitrogenase reductase (nifH) marker gene, and can be used to link N-fixation to other N- and C-cycling processes. Inorganic N entering soil via N-fixation, fertilization and deposition can have several fates, depending on the soil environment and the microbial community. The loss of N from forests stands subject to fertilization and atmospheric deposition is of increasing interest as the outputs of nitrate (NO3 -) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are implicated in ground water pollution and climate change, respectively. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) oxidize ammonia (NH3) to NO3 - as the first step of nitrification and are studied using the ammonium monooxygenase (amoA) marker. The abundance and community structure of ammonia-oxidizers is largely dependent on pH and availability of reactive N forms, and can change rapidly following N addition or after fire. These organisms can also release N2O during nitrifier denitrification or through linked nitrification-denitrification. In some forest soils, N2O emissions are correlated with genes in the denitrification pathway (napA, narG, nirK, nirS, nosZ) making these genes useful indicators of greenhouse gas (GHG) flux potential. A review of this topic is timely as there is currently much concern regarding the effect of N fertilization and deposition on North American and European forests due to the potential alteration of dissimilative N-cycling processes and the potential for increased N2O emissions in forest stands. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  volume = {17},
  issn = {13541013},
  abstract = {Recent findings on large nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from permafrost peatlands have shown that tundra soils can support high N2O release, which is on the contrary to what was thought previously. However, field data on this topic have been very limited, and the spatial and temporal extent of the phenomenon has not been known. To address this question, we studied N2O dynamics in two types of subarctic permafrost peatlands, a peat plateau in Russia and three palsa mires in Finland, including also adjacent upland soils. The peatlands studied have surfaces that are uplifted by frost (palsas and peat plateaus) and partly unvegetated as a result of wind erosion and frost action. Unvegetated peat surfaces with high N2O emissions were found from all the studied peatlands. Very high N2O emissions were measured from peat circles at the Russian site (1.40{$\pm$}0.15 g N2O m-2 yr-1). Elevated, sparsely vegetated peat mounds at the same site had significantly lower N2O release. The N2O emissions from bare palsa surfaces in Northern Finland were highly variable but reached high rates, similar to those measured from the peat circles. All the vegetated soils studied had negligible N2O release. At the bare peat surfaces, the large N2O emissions were supported by the absence of plant N uptake, the low C : N ratio of the peat, the relatively high gross N mineralization rate and favourable moisture content, together increasing availability of mineral N for N2O production. We hypothesize that frost heave is crucial for high N2O emissions, since it lifts the peat above the water table, increasing oxygen availability and making it vulnerable to the the physical processes that may remove the vegetation cover. In the future, permafrost thawing may change the distribution of wet and dry surfaces in permafrost peatlands, which will affect N2O emissions.},

  abstract = {We measured the litter chemistry of two co-dominant alpine species, Acomastylis rossii, a forb characterized by a low growth rate and N uptake capacity, and Deschampsia caespitosa, a grass characterized by a high growth rate and N uptake capacity, and examined the effect litter of these two species had on the growth of Deschampsia phytometers in a greenhouse. We also examined the influence of litter from the two species on microbial respiration and immobilization of N, in two separate laboratory microcosm experiments and in the field. We hypothesized that Acomastylis litter would reduce plant growth more than Deschampsia litter, corresponding with either 1) suppression of microbial activity and thus a decrease in N mineralization, or 2) by stimulation of microbial biomass and increasing microbial immobilization of N. Relative to Deschampsia litter, Acontastylis litter had higher total water soluble organic carbon (DOC), and higher total phenolic concentration. Deschampsia litter had 30 times higher carbohydrate (primarily glucose and fructose) concentrations than Acomastylis litter. Soil respiration, microbial biomass N, and consumption of DOC and N were higher with the Acomastylis litter treatment than the Deschampsia litter treatment in experimental microcosms, and both respiration and microbial biomass N were higher in field soils under canopies dominated by Acomastylis relative to those dominated by Deschampsia. These results indicate that phenolics in Acomastylis are a C source for soil microorganisms, rather than an inhibitor of microbial activity. Deschampsia phytometers grew significantly less, had higher root: shoot biomass ratios, and acquired less nitrogen in the Acomastylis litter treatment relative to the control and Deschampsia litter treatments. The results of these experiments indicate that Acomastylis litter influences soil N cycling by increasing microbial activity and N immobilization, which may influence N supply to neighboring plants. This mechanism has the potential to influence competitive interactions between Acomastylis and its neighbors.},

  abstract = {abstract abstract-type="summary" titleAbstract/title Diurnal variability in the rate of emission of nitrous oxide (N2O) from Iowa soils was studied by using a chamber technique to measure the N2O emission rates at sites on fertilized and unfertilized soils at 1- or 2-h intervals for periods of from 1 to 5 d. The coefficients of variation for the rates of N2O emission observed at these sites within 24-h periods ranged from 12 to 66\% and averaged 38\%. As much as 90\% of the diurnal variability observed could be attributed to diurnal N2O emission patterns related to changes in soil temperature. Observations reported suggest that these patterns were caused largely by changes in the solubility of N2O in soil water induced by diurnal changes in soil temperature, that the amplitudes of these patterns were determined largely by the amounts of water and N2O in the surface soil, that the times of minima and maxima in these patterns were determined by the depth at which temperature-induced changes in the solubility of N2O in water were significant, and that neither the amplitudes nor the times of minima and maxima in these patterns can be predicted solely from soil temperature. Data reported show that there is no short time during a 24-h period that is always satisfactory for assessing the amount of N2O evolved during that period.},

  abstract = {Metagenomics (also referred to as environmental and community genomics) is the genomic analysis of microorganisms by direct extraction and cloning of DNA from an assemblage of microorganisms. The development of metagenomics stemmed from the ineluctable evidence that as-yet-uncultured microorganisms represent the vast majority of organisms in most environments on earth. This evidence was derived from analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified directly from the environment, an approach that avoided the bias imposed by culturing and led to the discovery of vast new lineages of microbial life. Although the portrait of the microbial world was revolutionized by analysis of 16S rRNA genes, such studies yielded only a phylogenetic description of community membership, providing little insight into the genetics, physiology, and biochemistry of the members. Metagenomics provides a second tier of technical innovation that facilitates study of the physiology and ecology of environmental microorganisms. Novel genes and gene products discovered through metagenomics include the first bacteriorhodopsin of bacterial origin; novel small molecules with antimicrobial activity; and new members of families of known proteins, such as an Na+(Li+)/H+ antiporter, RecA, DNA polymerase, and antibiotic resistance determinants. Reassembly of multiple genomes has provided insight into energy and nutrient cycling within the community, genome structure, gene function, population genetics and microheterogeneity, and lateral gene transfer among members of an uncultured community. The application of metagenomic sequence information will facilitate the design of better culturing strategies to link genomic analysis with pure culture studies.},

  volume = {227},
  issn = {0032079X},
  abstract = {In 1988 an experiment was established at the Rodale Institute Experimental Farm to study weed control and nitrogen (N) management in rotations with grain crops and N-fixing green manures under reduced tillage without the use of herbicides. Tillage intensities ranging from moldboard plow (MP) to continuous no-till (NT) were compared. We present results for maize production in 1994, the seventh year of the experiment. Our goal was to further investigate reduced tillage regimes that alternated no-till with different forms of primary tillage in legume-based systems. In the chisel-disc (CD) and MP treatments comparable yields were achieved under so-called organic (weeds controlled with cultivation and green manure N source) and conventional management (weeds controlled with herbicides and mineral N fertilizer applied). Weed competition in these treatments was minimal and the N status of maize plants was essentially the same regardless of the N source (fertilizer or green manure). Of the four organic no-till maize treatments, only the mixed-tillage system with cultivation for weed control (CD-NTc) produced yields comparable to conventional NT maize. The fate of vetch N as well as temporal N dynamics were largely determined by tillage intensity and the handling of the vetch residues at maize planting. Treatments with primary tillage (CD and MP) had extremely high levels of mineral N early in the season and had greater average net N-mineralization, even though N content of hairy vetch in these treatments was equal to or lower than that in treatments with mow-killed vetch. In terms of soil mineral N concentrations, the CD-NTc treatment was similar to the other mow-killed vetch/no-till maize treatments. However, N availability in this treatment was greater, probably due to more complete decomposition of green manure residues. Cultivation for weeds not only helped control weeds but also increased mineralization of the vetch residues, which in turn increased the N supply during the period of maximum N demand by the maize. Carefully designed rotations combining tillage reductions with the use of leguminous N sources can have multiple benefits, including improved timing of N availability, reduced herbicide applications, and improved soil quality in the long term.},

  title = {Do Cover Crops Increase or Decrease Nitrous Oxide Emissions? {{A}} Meta-Analysis},
  volume = {69},
  issn = {0022-4561},
  abstract = {There are many environmental benefits to incorporating cover crops into crop rotations, such as their potential to decrease soil erosion, reduce nitrate (NO3) leaching, and increase soil organic matter. Some of these benefits impact other agroecosystem processes, such as greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, there is not a consensus in the literature regarding the effect of cover crops on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Compared to site-specific studies, meta-analysis can provide a more general investigation into these effects. Twenty-six peer-reviewed articles including 106 observations of cover crop effects on N2O emissions from the soil surface were analyzed according to their response ratio, the natural log of the N2O flux with a cover crop divided by the N2O flux without a cover crop (LRR). Forty percent of the observations had negative LRRs, indicating a cover crop treatment which decreased N2O, while 60\% had positive LRRs indicating a cover crop treatment which increased N2O. There was a significant interaction between N rate and the type of cover crop where legumes had higher LRRs at lower N rates than nonlegume species. When cover crop residues were incorporated into the soil, LRRs were significantly higher than those where residue was not incorporated. Geographies with higher total precipitation and variability in precipitation tended to produce higher LRRs. Finally, data points measured during cover crop decomposition had large positive LRRs and were larger than those measured when the cover crop was alive. In contrast, those data points measuring for a full year had LRRs close to zero, indicating that there was a balance between periods when cover crops increased N2O and periods when cover crops decreased emissions. Therefore, N2O measurements over the entire year may be needed to determine the net effect of cover crops on N2O. The data included in this meta-analysis indicate some overarching crop management practices that reduce direct N2O emissions from the soil surface, such as no soil incorporation of residues and use of non-legume cover crop species. However, our results demonstrate that cover crops do not always reduce direct N2O emissions from the soil surface in the short term and that more work is needed to understand the full global warming potential of cover crop management.},

  abstract = {Society relies on Earth system models (ESMs) to project future climate and carbon (C) cycle feedbacks. However, the soil C response to climate change is highly uncertain in these models1,2 and they omit key biogeochemical mechanisms3\textendash{}5. Specifically, the traditional approach in ESMs lacks direct microbial control over soil C dynamics6\textendash{}8. Thus, we tested a new model that explicitly represents microbial mechanisms of soil C cycling on the global scale. Compared with traditional models, the microbial model simulates soil C pools that more closely match contemporary observations. It also projects a much wider range of soil C responses to climate change over the twenty-first century. Global soils accumulate C if microbial growth efficiency declines with warming in the microbial model. If growth efficiency adapts to warming, the microbial model projects large soil C losses. By comparison, traditional models project modest soil C losses with global warming. Microbes also change the soil response to increased C inputs, as might occur with CO2 or nutrient fertilization. In the microbial model, microbes consume these additional inputs; whereas in traditional models, additional inputs lead to C storage. Our results indicate that ESMs should simulate microbial physiology to more accurately project climate change feedbacks.},

  issn = {09291393},
  abstract = {The Amazon Rainforest plays major roles in global carbon and nitrogen cycling. Despite this region's immense importance, deforestation and pasture creation are still occurring at alarming rates. In this study, we investigated the effects of land-use change on aerobic ammonia-oxidizers in primary rainforest, young and old pasture, and secondary forest in Rond??nia, Brazil. Forest-to-pasture conversion decreased soil nitrate, phosphorus, and exchangeable acidity contents that recovered to pre-disturbance levels as pastures aged or were abandoned and formed secondary forest. The ammonia-oxidizing community, numerically dominated by thaumarchaea, shifted due to land-use change, both in terms of gene abundance and community structure. However, thaumarchaeal ammonia monooxygenase gene abundances did not correlate with any measured soil physicochemial parameters. Phylogenetic analyses showed that community structural changes in ammonia-oxidizing thaumarchaea are driven by a shift away from primary rainforest, old pasture, and secondary forest clusters to separate clusters for young pasture. Additionally, the nearly complete disappearance in young pasture, old pasture, and secondary forest sites of a thaumarchaeal genus, the Nitrosotalea, indicates that land-use change can have long lasting effects on large portions of the thaumarchaeal community. The results of this study can be used as a conceptual foundation for determining how ammonia-oxidizers become altered by land-use change in South American tropical forests.},

  abstract = {Bacillus is commonly isolated from soils, with organisms of Bacillus cereus sensu lato being prevalent. Knowledge of the ecology of B. cereus and other Bacillus species in soil is far from complete. While the older literature favors a model of growth on soil-associated organic matter, the current paradigm is that B. cereus sensu lato germinates and grows in association with animals or plants, resulting in either symbiotic or pathogenic interactions. An in terra approach to study soil-associated bacteria is described, using filter-sterilized soil-extracted soluble organic matter (SESOM) and artificial soil microcosms (ASM) saturated with SESOM. B. cereus ATCC 14579 displayed a life cycle, with the ability to germinate, grow, and subsequently sporulate in both the liquid SESOM extract and in ASM inserted into wells in agar medium. Cells grew in liquid SESOM without separating, forming multicellular structures that coalesced to form clumps and encasing the ensuing spores in an extracellular matrix. Bacillus was able to translocate from the point of inoculation through soil microcosms as shown by the emergence of outgrowths on the surrounding agar surface. Microscopic inspection revealed bundles of parallel chains inside the soil. The motility inhibitor L-ethionine failed to suppress outgrowth, ruling out translocation by a flagellar-mediated mechanism such as swimming or swarming. Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis Marburg and four Bacillus isolates taken at random from soils also displayed a life cycle in SESOM and ASM and were all able to translocate through ASM, even in presence of L-ethionine. These data indicate that B. cereus is a saprophytic bacterium that is able to grow in soil and furthermore that it is adapted to translocate by employing a multicellular mode of growth.},

  abstract = {In organic farming, reduced tillage is often avoided because of potentially negative consequences for crops and weeds. On an experimental organic farm in Germany, we studied during three years the effects of the three tillage systems mouldboard ploughing (MP, inversion to 30. cm depth), two layer ploughing (TP, inversion to 15. cm, loosening to 30. cm) and layer cultivation (LC, only loosening to 30. cm) on soil properties, root and shoot growth of barley and rye and their associated weeds. The different tillage systems were applied for five consecutive years prior to the initiation of the current study within a five-course crop rotation consisting of green fallows, peas and cereals. During the current investigation, different tillage systems were applied after cereal harvests only resulting in different time periods between tillage and seeding for barley and rye. Generally, differences between tillage systems were most pronounced between LC and MP or TP while effects of MP and TP were similar. Soil aggregate stability under both crops was on average 46\% and 18\% higher at LC than at MP and TP, respectively. Soil penetration resistance under barley was on average 199\% higher at LC than at MP (p = 0.012); under rye tillage systems had no effect on penetration resistance. Soil respiration was unaffected by tillage systems under both crops. Root length density (RLD) under barley was in the first two years 50\% higher at MP than at LC in 20-30. cm soil depth; in the third year 32\% higher under TP than MP or LC in the upper soil horizons. RLD under rye was unaffected by tillage treatments. Barley shoot mass was 38\% lower at LC and 24\% lower at TP than at MP (p = 0.044), rye shoot mass was in two years not influenced (p = 0.58). Weed shoot mass in barley was across years 88\% and 65\% higher at LC than at MP and TP, respectively; under rye no clear influence of tillage systems on weed shoot mass was observed. Experimental years differed considerably regarding annual precipitation and mean air temperatures and significantly influenced all parameters measured, however did not interact with the tillage treatments for most parameters. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Three farmlets were stocked at 3n3 cows\textbackslash{}ha and received nominal rates of N fertilizer (urea in 8\textendash{}10 split applications) of 0, 200 or 400 kg N\textbackslash{}ha per year. A fourth farmlet with 4n4 cows\textbackslash{}ha received 400 kg N\textbackslash{}ha per year and was supplemented with maize grain during the first two years. Nitrogen balances were calculated, with {$\Sigma$}N inputs \$  outputs. Annual inputs from N \# fixation were 99\textendash{}231 kg N\textbackslash{}ha in the 0 N farmlet, but declined to 15\textendash{}44 kg N\textbackslash{}ha in the 400 N farmlets. The main N outputs (in kg N\textbackslash{}ha per year) were in milk (72\textendash{}126), nitrate leaching (20\textendash{}204), and transfer of N via cow excreta from pastures to lanes and milking shed (54\textendash{}92). Gaseous losses by denitrification (3\textendash{}34) and volatilization (15\textendash{}78) were smaller than the other N outputs but increased significantly with N fertilizer application. In the maize-supplemented farmlet, N outputs in milk were 31 \% higher than in the corresponding non-supplemented 400 N farmlet, whereas leaching losses averaged 17 \% lower during the 2 years of supplementation. In the N-fertilized farmlets, estimated N balances were influenced by inclusion of the transitional N processes of immobilization of fertilizer N into the soil organic N pool (estimated using "\&N at 42\textendash{}94 kg N\textbackslash{}ha per year) and the contribution from mineralization of residual clover-fixed N in soil not accounted for in the current estimates of N \# fixation (estimated at up to 70 \% of measured N \# fixation or 46 kg N\textbackslash{}ha per year). However, these processes were counteracting and together were calculated to have only a small net effect on total N balances. The output of N in products (milk, meat and feed) relative to the total N input averaged 26 \% in the 400 N farmlets, and is compared to that measured for commercial intensively-managed dairy farms in England and the Netherlands (14\textendash{}20 \%). The 0 N farmlet, which was reliant on N \# fixation as the sole N input, was relatively very N-efficient with the milk production being 83 \% of that in the 400 N farmlet (at 3n3 cows\textbackslash{}ha) and the N output in products relative to total N input averaging 52 \%.},

A Weswood silty clay loam (fine, mixed, thermic Fluventic Ustochrept) in south-central Texas was sampled after planting in April, during flowering in June, and following sorghum harvest in August. More crop residue C input was retained as SOC and SMBC under NT than under CT. Soil organic C, SMBC, SMBN, and mineralizable C and N were greatest at a depth of 0 to 50 mm under NT. Mineralizable C and SMBC averaged 18\% greater in rotation than in monoculture, probably due to greater C input via crop roots and residues in rotation and a shorter fallow. Mineralizable N with N fertilization was 36\% greater in continuous sorghum but not different in rotated sorghum. Mineralizable C and SMBC increased an average of 5\%, but mineralizable N decreased 41\% from planting to flowering, probably due to rhizodeposition. From planting to post-harvest, mineralizable C and SMBC increased 9\% but mineralizable N decreased 15\% due to crop residue addition. Soil N availability was reduced by plant additions in the short term but enhanced in the long term.},

Stable isotope techniques have a crucial role to play in the attribution of N2O emissions to different microbial processes, through estimation (natural abun- dance, site preference) or quantification (enrichment) of processes based on the 15N and 18O signatures of N2O determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. These approaches have the potential to become even more powerful when linked with recent developments in secondary isotope mass spectrometry, with microbial ecology, and with modelling approaches, enabling sources ofN2Oto be considered at awide range of scales and related to the underlying microbiology. Such source partitioning ofN2Ois inherently challenging, but is vital to close theN2Obudget and to better understand controls on the different processes, with a view to developing appropriate management practices for mitigation of N2O. In this respect, it is essential that as many of the contributing processes as possible are considered in any study aimed at source attribution, as mitigation strategies for one process may not be appropriate for another. To aid such an approach, here the current state of the art is critically examined, remaining challenges are highlighted, and recommendations are made for future direction.

  abstract = {Biogenic production and release of methane (CH4) from thawing permafrost has the potential to be a strong source of radiative forcing. We investigated changes in the active layer microbial community of three sites representative of distinct permafrost thaw stages at a palsa mire in northern Sweden. The palsa sites with intact permafrost, and low radiative forcing signature had a phylogenetically clustered community dominated by Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria. The bog with thawing permafrost and low radiative forcing signature was dominated by hydrogenotrophic methanogens and Acidobacteria, had lower alpha diversity, and midrange phylogenetic clustering, characteristic of ecosystem disturbance affecting habitat filtering, shifting from palsa-like to fen-like at the waterline. The fen had no underlying permafrost, and the highest alpha, beta and phylogenetic diversity, was dominated by Proteobacteria and Euryarchaeota, and was significantly enriched in methanogens. The mire microbial network was modular with module cores consisting of clusters of Acidobacteria, Euryarchaeota, or Xanthomonodales. Loss of underlying permafrost with associated hydrological shifts correlated to changes in microbial composition, alpha, beta, and phylogenetic diversity associated with a higher radiative forcing signature. These results support the complex role of microbial interactions in mediating carbon budget changes and climate feedback in response to climate forcing. Page 2 of 43 Introduction},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects 70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged {$\geq$}60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

We find a suite of bacterial and fungal groups contributing to nitrogen cycling and a reproducible network of decomposers that emerge on predictable timescales. The results show this decomposer community is derived primarily from bulk soil, but key decomposers are ubiquitous in low abundance. Soil type was not a dominant factor driving community development and the process of decomposition is sufficiently reproducible that it offers unique opportunities for forensic investigations.},

(2016) report a new study of fluids in the peridotites of the Samail ophiolite in Oman related to modern serpentinization (olivine hydration), a process that can provide energy and raw materials for chemosynthetic microbial life. The authors, in particular, report an isotopic composition for methane (CH4) in groundwater near Ibra (up to 1.4 mM) that is unusually 13C-enriched ({$\delta$}13CCH4 {$\sim$} +2.4 and +3 \textperthousand{} VPDB), and consider the gas origin to be uncertain, i.e., abiotic or microbial, and to be modulated by significant fractionation due to oxidation or diffusion. The purpose of this comment is to clarify and correct a few points concerning the possible origin of the {$\delta$}13CCH4 values, with the intention to promote a fruitful and constructive debate, considering the interest that there is for serpentinization and the associated formation of various gases. The CH4 data from Miller et al. are re-examined in a global context of gas in serpentinized peridotites and, in particular, by considering published data (isotope composition of CH4 and concentrations of C2+ alkanes) also obtained from the Samail ophiolite, data neglected by the authors. These data significantly impact the interpretation of Miller et al. concerning the possibility that methane can be microbial. Potential isotopic fractionations by oxidation or diffusion, evaluated considering {$\delta$}13CCH4\textendash{$\delta$}2HCH4 correlated variations, the occurrence of significant amounts of ethane and propane in the Oman ophiolite aquifers and Rayleigh fractionation analysis suggest that methane can hardly be considered microbial. Isotopic fractionations, however, are not necessary to explain the unusual {$\delta$}13CCH4 values: an alternative hypothesis is that methane carbon may derive from 13C-enriched carbonates occurring below the Samail ophiolite nappe, a hypothesis not considered by Miller et al.},

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important trace gas in the atmosphere. It is an active greenhouse gas in the troposphere and it also controls ozone concentration in the stratosphere through nitric oxide production. One way to trace the geochemical cycle of N2O is by measuring the natural abundance of stable isotopes, namely 15N and 18O (refs 2-15). Here we report the intramolecular distribution of 15N within the linear NNO molecule, determined by measuring molecular and fragment ions of N2O on a modified mass spectrometer. This revealed a preference for 15N at the central N position, or alpha-site, within N2O isotopomers (isotope-containing molecules). Moreover, this preference varied significantly throughout the atmosphere. In the troposphere, low alpha-site preference indicates local emission of N2O from soils and fossil-fuel combustion, each with distinct isotopomer signatures, which then mixes with background N2O. In the stratosphere, on the other hand, loss of N2O is observed as enhanced alpha-site preference for 15N, due to fractionation during ultraviolet photolysis of N2O. We have constructed an atmospheric mass balance of N2O, incorporating isotopomer abundance, which shows that the intramolecular distribution of 15N is a parameter that has the potential to increase significantly the resolution with which sources and sinks of N2O can be identified and quantified in the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems in the humid tropics play a potentially important but presently ambiguous role in the global carbon cycle. Whereas global estimates of atmospheric CO2 exchange indicate that the tropics are near equilibrium or are a source with respect to carbon, ground-based estimates indicate that the amount of carbon that is being absorbed by mature rainforests is similar to or greater than that being released by tropical deforestation (about 1.6 Gt C yr-1). Estimates of the magnitude of carbon sequestration are uncertain, however, depending on whether they are derived from measurements of gas fluxes above forests or of biomass accumulation in vegetation and soils. It is also possible that methodological errors may overestimate rates of carbon uptake or that other loss processes have yet to be identified. Here we demonstrate that outgassing (evasion) of CO2 from rivers and wetlands of the central Amazon basin constitutes an important carbon loss process, equal to 1.2 +/- 0.3 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. This carbon probably originates from organic matter transported from upland and flooded forests, which is then respired and outgassed downstream. Extrapolated across the entire basin, this flux-at 0.5 Gt C yr-1-is an order of magnitude greater than fluvial export of organic carbon to the ocean. From these findings, we suggest that the overall carbon budget of rainforests, summed across terrestrial and aquatic environments, appears closer to being in balance than would be inferred from studies of uplands alone.},

One component of anaerobic carbon cycling, homoacetogenesis (i.e., acetate formation from carbon dioxide and dihydrogen via the acetyl-CoA pathway), has rarely been quantified in natural environments because it is commonly viewed as being thermodynamically unfavorable. Here we show that in a laboratory incubation using a tracer method, homoacetogenesis occurred at significant rates in soils from three peatlands (bog, intermediate fen, and cedar swamp) despite thermodynamic conditions that appeared to be unfavorable for this process. Homoacetogens consumed dihydrogen at rates up to 3- to 10-times faster than methanogens, and homoacetogenesis accounted for 16-63\% of total acetate production, with the balance likely coming from fermentation processes. Our results show that homoacetogenesis can play an important role in regulating acetate dynamics, methane production, and carbon cycling in peatlands. ?? 2013.},

Although researchers have begun cataloging the incredible diversity of bacteria found in soil, we are largely unable to interpret this information in an ecological context, including which groups of bacteria are most abundant in different soils and why. With this study, we examined how the abundances of major soil bacterial phyla correspond to.the biotic and abiotic characteristics of the soil environment to determine if they can be divided into ecologically meaningful categories. To do this, we collected 71 unique soil samples from a wide range of ecosystems across North America and looked for relationships between soil properties and the relative abundances of six dominant bacterial phyla (Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, oc-Proteobacteria, and the ?-Proteobacteria). Of the soil properties measured, net carbon (C) mineralization rate (an index of C availability) was the best predictor of phylum-level abundances. There was a negative correlation between Acidobacteria abundance and C mineralization rates (r2 = 0.26, P  0.001), while the abundances of ?-Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were positively correlated with C mineralization rates (r2 = 0.35, P  0.001 and r2 = 0.34, P  0.001, respectively). These patterns were explored further using both experimental and meta-analytical approaches. We amended soil cores from a specific site with varying levels of sucrose over a 12-month period to maintain a gradient of elevated C availabilities. This experiment confirmed our survey results: there was a negative relationship between C amendment level and the abundance of Acidobacteria (r2 = 0.42, P  0.01) and a positive relationship for both Bacteroidetes and ? Proteobacteria (r2 = 0.38 and 0.70, respectively; P  0.01 for each). Further support for a relationship between the relative abundances of these bacterial phyla and C availability was garnered from an analysis of published bacterial clone libraries from bulk and rhizosphere soils. Together our survey, experimental, and meta-analytical results suggest that certain bacterial phyla can be differentiated into copiotrophic and oligotrophic categories that correspond to the r-and /\^-selected categories used to describe the ecological attributes of plants and animals. By applying the copiotroph-oligotroph concept to soil microorganisms we can make specific predictions about the ecological attributes of various bacterial taxa and better understand the structure and function of soil bacterial communities.},

  volume = {35},
  issn = {00380717},
  abstract = {Soil profiles are often many meters deep, but with the majority of studies in soil microbiology focusing exclusively on the soil surface, we know very little about the nature of the microbial communities inhabiting the deeper soil horizons. We used phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis to examine the vertical distribution of specific microbial groups and to identify the patterns of microbial abundance and community-level diversity within the soil profile. Samples were collected from the soil surface down to 2 m in depth from two unsaturated Mollisol profiles located near Santa Barbara, CA, USA. While the densities of microorganisms were generally one to two orders of magnitude lower in the deeper horizons of both profiles than at the soil surface, approximately 35\% of the total quantity of microbial biomass found in the top 2 m of soil is found below a depth of 25 cm. Principal components analysis of the PLFA signatures indicates that the composition of the soil microbial communities changes significantly with soil depth. The differentiation of microbial communities within the two profiles coincides with an overall decline in microbial diversity. The number of individual PLFAs detected in soil samples decreased by about a third from the soil surface down to 2 m. The ratios of cyclopropyl/monoenoic precursors and total saturated/total monounsaturated fatty acids increased with soil depth, suggesting that the microbes inhabiting the deeper soil horizons are more carbon limited than surface-dwelling microbes. Using PLFAs as biomarkers, we show that Gram-positive bacteria and actinomycetes tended to increase in proportional abundance with increasing soil depth, while the abundances of Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa were highest at the soil surface and substantially lower in the subsurface. The vertical distribution of these specific microbial groups can largely be attributed to the decline in carbon availability with soil depth. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  title = {Managing the Trade off between Nitrogen Supply and Retention with Cover Crop Mixtures},
  volume = {237},
  issn = {01678809},
  abstract = {The ability of cover crop mixtures to provide both nitrogen (N) retention and N supply services has been extensively studied in research station experiments, especially with grass-legume bicultures. Mixtures are often as effective as grass monocultures at N retention, but the N supply service can be compromised when non-legumes dilute the presence of legumes in a cover crop stand. To study the tradeoffs between N retention and supply when using cover crop mixtures, we measured N retention and supply in distributed on-farm experiments, developed multiple linear regression models to predict N retention and supply based on cover crop functional characteristics and environmental variables, and synthesized the regression models into a graphical analysis tool. The experiments took place on three organic farms and a research station in Pennsylvania, USA and tested 3-species and 4-species cover crop mixtures in comparison to commonly used grass and legume monocultures. Cover crop treatments were planted between a small grain crop harvested in mid-summer and a maize (Zea mays L.) crop planted the following spring. Potential nitrate (NO3-) leaching below 30 cm, an indicator of the N retention service, declined as the presence of non-legume species in a cover crop increased (r2 = 0.72). Potential NO3- leaching increased as the August soil NO3--N concentration increased and as the fall biomass N content of winter-killed species or canola (Brassica napus L. `Wichita') increased. Relative maize yield, an indicator of the N supply service, decreased as fall and spring cover crop biomass carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratios increased and increased as total spring biomass N content and soil carbon (C) concentration increased (r2 = 0.56). Synthesizing the regression models in a graphical analysis tool revealed a tradeoff between N supply and retention services for cover crop mixtures, where increasing the fractional non-legume seeding rate to reduce potential NO3- leaching also reduced relative maize yield. The tradeoff could be minimized by managing environmental conditions and cover crop composition so that potential NO3- leaching remains low even when the fractional non-legume seeding rate is low. The regression models suggest this could be achieved by maintaining low soil NO3--N concentrations prior to cover crop planting in August, not including winter-killed legumes in the mixture, and using non-legume species that are the most efficient at N retention. Thus, with thoughtful management of cover crops and soils, farmers may be able to realize the potential of cover crop mixtures to provide high levels of both N retention and supply services.},

Unfortunately, traditional interpretations of time-dependent chamber concentrations often systematically underestimate predeployment exchange rates because they do not accurately represent the fundamental physics of diffusive soil gas transport that follows chamber deployment. To address this issue, we formally derived a time-dependent diffusion model applicable to NSS chamber observations and evaluated its performance using simulated chamber headspace CO2 concentration data generated by an independent, three-dimensional, numerical diffusion model. Using nonlinear regression to estimate the model parameters, we compared the performance of the non-steady-state diffusive flux estimator (NDFE) to that of the linear, quadratic, and steady-state diffusion models that are widely cited in the literature, determined its sensitivity to violation of the primary assumptions on which it is based, and addressed some of the practicalities of its application. In sharp contrast to the other models, NDFE proved an accurate and robust estimator of trace gas emissions across a wide range of soil, chamber design, and deployment scenarios.},

  abstract = {Cover crops have long been touted for their ability to reduce erosion, fix atmospheric nitrogen, reduce nitrogen leaching, and improve soil health. In recent decades, there has been resurgence in cover crop adoption that is synchronous with a heightened awareness of climate change. Climate change mitigation and adaptation may be additional, important ecosystem services provided by cover crops, but they lie outside of the traditional list of cover cropping benefits. Here, we review the potential for cover crops to mitigate climate change by tallying all of the positive and negative impacts of cover crops on the net global warming potential of agricultural fields. Then, we use lessons learned from two contrasting regions to evaluate how cover crops affect adaptive management for precipitation and temperature change. Three key outcomes from this synthesis are (1) Cover crop effects on greenhouse gas fluxes typically mitigate warming by \~100 to 150 g CO2 e/m2/year, which is higher than mitigation from transitioning to no-till. The most important terms in the budget are soil carbon sequestration and reduced fertilizer use after legume cover crops. (2) The surface albedo change due to cover cropping, calculated for the first time here using case study sites in central Spain and Pennsylvania, USA, may mitigate 12 to 46 g CO2 e/m2/year over a 100-year time horizon. And (3) Cover crop management can also enable climate change adaptation at these case study sites, especially through reduced vulnerability to erosion from extreme rain events, increased soil water management options during droughts or periods of soil saturation, and retention of nitrogen mineralized due to warming. Overall, we found very few tradeoffs between cover cropping and climate change mitigation and adaptation, suggesting that ecosystem services that are traditionally expected from cover cropping can be promoted synergistically with services related to climate change.},

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of methane (CH4 ) emissions is of paramount importance because CH4 has 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and is currently the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas. Wetlands are the single largest natural CH4 source with median emissions from published studies of 164 Tg~yr(-1) , which is about a third of total global emissions. We provide a perspective on important new frontiers in obtaining a better understanding of CH4 dynamics in natural systems, with a focus on wetlands. One of the most exciting recent developments in this field is the attempt to integrate the different methodologies and spatial scales of biogeochemistry, molecular microbiology, and modeling, and thus this is a major focus of this review. Our specific objectives are to provide an up-to-date synthesis of estimates of global CH4 emissions from wetlands and other freshwater aquatic ecosystems, briefly summarize major biogeophysical controls over CH4 emissions from wetlands, suggest new frontiers in CH4 biogeochemistry, examine relationships between methanogen community structure and CH4 dynamics in situ, and to review the current generation of CH4 models. We highlight throughout some of the most pressing issues concerning global change and feedbacks on CH4 emissions from natural ecosystems. Major uncertainties in estimating current and future CH4 emissions from natural ecosystems include the following: (i) A number of important controls over CH4 production, consumption, and transport have not been, or are inadequately, incorporated into existing CH4 biogeochemistry models. (ii) Significant errors in regional and global emission estimates are derived from large spatial-scale extrapolations from highly heterogeneous and often poorly mapped wetland complexes. (iii) The limited number of observations of CH4 fluxes and their associated environmental variables loosely constrains the parameterization of process-based biogeochemistry models.},

  volume = {35},
  issn = {00380717},
  abstract = {Using pre-established trial sites on allophanic soils, we investigated the impacts of long to medium-term pastoral management practices, such as fertilisation and grazing intensity, on a range of soil biological and biochemical properties; hot water-extractable C (HWC), water-soluble C (WSC), hot-water extractable total carbohydrates, microbial biomass-C and N and mineralisable N. These properties were examined for their usefulness as soil quality indicators responding to changes in the rhizosphere caused by management practices. Adjacent cropping, market garden and native bush sites located on similar soil types were included to determine the changes in soil biological and biochemical properties resulting from changes in land use. The seasonal variability of HWC and its relationship with other labile fractions of soil organic matter was also examined. Microbial biomass-C, mineralisable N and extractable total carbohydrates showed promise in differentiating treatment and land use effects. However, HWC was one of the most sensitive and consistent indicators examined at 52 different sites. The impact of different land uses on the amounts of HWC in the same soil type was far greater than that was observed for the soil organic carbon. The average values of HWC for soil under different land use were: native (4000 ??g C g-1 soil), sheep/beef pastures (3400), dairy pastures (3000), cropping (1000) and market gardening soils (850). HWC was also sensitive to differences within an ecosystem, e.g. effects of grazing intensities and effects of N or P fertilisers on pastures. The sheep and beef/cattle grazed pastures always had higher amounts of HWC than the intensively grazed dairy pastures. Nitrogen fertiliser application (200 and 400 kg N ha-1 yr-1) over the previous 5 yr had significant (P  0.001) negative impacts on HWC and other soil microbial properties. In contrast, long-term application of P fertilisers had a significant (P  0.001) positive effect on the HWC levels in pastoral soils. In the case of long-term P trials, HWC increased even though no increase in the total soil carbon pool was detected. HWC was positively correlated with soil microbial biomass-C (R2 = 0.84), microbial nitrogen (R2 = 0.72), mineralisable N (R2 = 0.86), and total carbohydrates (R2 = 0.88). All these correlations were significant at P  0.001 level of significance. The HWC was also positively correlated with WSC and total organic C. However, these correlations were poorer than those found for other soil parameters. Most of these measurements have been actively promoted as key indicators of soil quality. Given the strong correlations between HWC and other biochemical measurements, HWC could be used as an integrated measure of soil quality. When HWC is extracted, other pools of labile nutrients are also extracted along with C. Therefore it is suggested that decline in HWC would also indicate a decline in other labile organic pools of nutrients such as nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus. About 40-50\% of the C in the HWC extract was present as carbohydrates. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Microbes exist in a range of metabolic states (for example, dormant, active and growing) and analysis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is frequently employed to identify the `active' fraction of microbes in environmental samples. While rRNA analyses are no longer commonly used to quantify a population's growth rate in mixed communities, due to rRNA concentration not scaling linearly with growth rate uniformly across taxa, rRNA analyses are still frequently used toward the more conservative goal of identifying populations that are currently active in a mixed community. Yet, evidence indicates that the general use of rRNA as a reliable indicator of metabolic state in microbial assemblages has serious limitations. This report highlights the complex and often contradictory relationships between rRNA, growth and activity. Potential mechanisms for confounding rRNA patterns are discussed, including differences in life histories, life strategies and non-growth activities. Ways in which rRNA data can be used for useful characterization of microbial assemblages are presented, along with questions to be addressed in future studies.},

  issn = {00380717},
  abstract = {The relationships between the denitrification capacities of 17 surface soils and the amounts of total organic carbon, mineralizable carbon, and water-soluble organic carbon in these soils were investigated. The soils used differed markedly in pH, texture, and organic-matter content. Denitrification capacity was assessed by determining the N evolved as N2 and N2O on anaerobic incubation of nitrate-treated soil at 20\textdegree{}C for 7 days, and mineralizable carbon was assessed by determining the C evolved as CO2 on aerobic incubation of soil at 20\textdegree{}C for 7 days. The denitrification capacities of the soils studied were significantly correlated (r = 0\textperiodcentered{}77{${_\ast}{_\ast}{_\ast}$}) with total organic carbon and very highly correlated (r = 0\textperiodcentered{}99{${_\ast}{_\ast}{_\ast}$}) with water-soluble organic carbon or mineralizable carbon. The amount of nitrate N lost on anaerobic incubation of nitrate-treated soils for 7 days was very closely related (r = 0\textperiodcentered{}999{${_\ast}{_\ast}{_\ast}$}) to the amount of N evolved as N2 and N2O. The work reported indicates that denitrification in soils under anaerobic conditions is controlled largely by the supply of readily decomposable organic matter and that analysis of soils for mineralizable carbon or water-soluble organic carbon provides a good index of their capacity for denitrification of nitrate.},

  abstract = {The reductases performing the four steps of denitrification are controlled by a network of transcriptional regulators and ancillary factors responding to intra- and extracellular signals, amongst which are oxygen and N oxides (NO and NO2(-)). Although many components of the regulatory network have been identified, there are gaps in our understanding of their role(s) in controlling the expression of the various reductases, in particular the environmentally important N(2)O reductase (N(2)OR). We investigated denitrification phenotypes of Paracoccus denitrificans mutants deficient in: (i) regulatory proteins (three FNR-type transcriptional regulators, NarR, NNR and FnrP, and NirI, which is involved in transcription activation of the structural nir cluster); (ii) functional enzymes (NO reductase and N(2)OR); or (iii) ancillary factors involved in N(2)O reduction (NirX and NosX). A robotized incubation system allowed us to closely monitor changes in concentrations of oxygen and all gaseous products during the transition from oxic to anoxic respiration. Strains deficient in NO reductase were able to grow during denitrification, despite reaching micromolar concentrations of NO, but were unable to return to oxic respiration. The FnrP mutant showed linear anoxic growth in a medium with nitrate as the sole NO(x), but exponential growth was restored by replacing nitrate with nitrite. We interpret this as nitrite limitation, suggesting dual transcriptional control of respiratory nitrate reductase (NAR) by FnrP and NarR. Mutations in either NirX or NosX did not affect the phenotype, but the double mutant lacked the potential to reduce N(2)O. Finally, we found that FnrP and NNR are alternative and equally effective inducers of N(2)OR.},

  abstract = {Legume cover crops can often meet much of the N demand of a crop. There may be, however, an asynchrony between N mineralization from the cover crop residues and crop N uptake, resulting in potentially substantial N loss. We hypothesized that manipulation of hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.) termination and corn (Zea mays L.) planting dates would regulate the quantity of N available from the vetch, the mineralization rate from the vetch residues, and the relative rate of N uptake in the corn. Field experiments were implemented in 2007 and 2008 to study the integrative effects of delaying vetch termination/corn planting through the establishment of three termination/planting dates within the month of May (an early, middle, and late date). Greater vetch biomass was found as the termination date was delayed, with a 360 and 35\% biomass gain in 2007 and 2008, respectively, over 4 wk. The soil N content, for all termination dates, followed a similar availability trend across the season in both years, but the quantity of inorganic N in the soil varied depending on termination date. The average corn grain yield in 2007 was 8.0 Mg ha(-1) under vetch fertilization, with no difference among vetch biomass levels, and in 2008, ranged between 4.4 and 7.6 Mg ha(-1), with significant differences depending on vetch biomass level. Our study concluded that although vetch N availability can be manipulated through termination date, the dependence on climate for vetch biomass levels and N release will complicate year-to-year predictability.},

  volume = {28},
  issn = {10970231},
  abstract = {RATIONALE: In recent years, research and applications of the N2O site-specific nitrogen isotope composition have advanced, reflecting awareness of the contribution of N2O to the anthropogenic greenhouse effect, and leading to significant progress in instrument development. Further dissemination of N2O isotopomer analysis, however, is hampered by a lack of internationally agreed gaseous N2O reference materials and an uncertain compatibility of different laboratories and analytical techniques. METHODS: In a first comparison approach, eleven laboratories were each provided with N2O at tropospheric mole fractions (target gas T) and two reference gases (REF1 and REF2). The laboratories analysed all gases, applying their specific analytical routines. Compatibility of laboratories was assessed based on N2O isotopocule data for T, REF1 and REF2. Results for T were then standardised using REF1 and REF2 to evaluate the potential of N2O reference materials for improving compatibility between laboratories. RESULTS: Compatibility between laboratories depended on the analytical technique: isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) results showed better compatibility for {$\delta$}(15)N values, while the performance of laser spectroscopy was superior with respect to N2O site preference. This comparison, however, is restricted by the small number of participating laboratories applying laser spectroscopy. Offset and two-point calibration correction of the N2O isotopomer data significantly improved the consistency of position-dependent nitrogen isotope data while the effect on {$\delta$}(15)N values was only minor. CONCLUSIONS: The study reveals that for future research on N2O isotopocules, standardisation against N2O reference material is essential to improve interlaboratory compatibility. For atmospheric monitoring activities, we suggest N2O in whole air as a unifying scale anchor.},

  issn = {0308521X},
  abstract = {APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) is a software system which provides a flexible structure for the simulation of climatic and soil management effects on growth of crops in farming systems and changes in the soil resource. The focus of this paper is the predictive performance of APSIM for simulation of soil water and nitrate nitrogen in contrasting soils (vertisols and alfisols) and environments. The three APSIM modules that determine the dynamics of water, carbon, and nitrogen in the soil system (viz. SOIL WAT, SOILN and RESIDUE v. 1) are described in terms of the processes represented, with particular emphasis on aspects of their coding that differ from their precursors in CERES and PERFECT. The most fundamental change is in SOILN, which now provides a formal balance of both carbon and nitrogen in the soil and includes a labile soil organic matter pool that decomposes more rapidly than the bulk of the soil organic matter. Model performance, in terms of prediction of soil water and nitrate, is evaluated during fallows, thereby avoiding complications arising from water use and nitrogen uptake by a crop. One data set is from a long-term experiment on a vertisol in southeast Queensland which studied two tillage treatments (conventional and zero tillage) in combination with fertiliser nitrogen inputs for the growth of wheat; soil water and nitrate were measured twice each year (pre-planting and post-harvest). The second comes from experiments at Katherine, Northern Territory, where legume leys growing on alfisols were chemically killed and ensuing changes in soil water and nitrate were measured during a single season. For both datasets, the predictive ability of the model was satisfactory for water and nitrate, in terms of both the total amounts in the whole profile and their distribution with depth. Since neither of these datasets included measurements of the runoff component of the water balance, this aspect of model performance was evaluated, and shown to be generally good, using data from a third source where runoff had been measured from contour bay catchments.},

Our understanding of how this belowground biodiversity is distributed, and how it regulates the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, is rapidly growing. Evidence also points to soil biodiversity as having a key role in determining the ecological and evolu-tionary responses of terrestrial ecosystems to current and future environmental change. Here we review recent progress and propose avenues for further research in this field. T he last two decades have witnessed an enormous research effort directed at understanding how biodiversity loss impacts ecosystem functioning, and the influence of this on the goods and services that ecosystems provide 1 . This research has led to the general consensus that biodiversity loss reduces most ecosystem functions and impairs their sta-bility over time, and that functional traits of species have a major role in determining diversity effects 1 . The majority of research on this topic, how-ever, has had an aboveground focus; as a result, our understanding of the functional consequences of biodiversity loss belowground is less well developed. This lack of knowledge hampers our ability to predict the con-sequences of realistic scenarios of diversity change, especially since below-ground biodiversity represents one of the largest reservoirs of biological diversity on Earth 2,3},

  volume = {118},
  issn = {01671987},
  abstract = {Recent literature on no-till is reviewed with particular emphasis on research on commercial uptake and environmental concerns in northern, western and south-western Europe. Increased interest in no-till, and minimum or reduced tillage, results from changes in the economic circumstances of crop production, the opportunity to increase the area of more profitable autumn-sown crops and increased concern about environmental damage associated with soil inversion by ploughing. Highly contrasting soil and climate types within and between these regions exert a strong influence on the success of no-till. While no-till may often result in crop yields which equal or exceed those obtained after ploughing, modest reductions in yield may be tolerated if production costs are lower than with ploughing. The relative costs of fuel and herbicides have changed appreciably in recent years making no-till more attractive commercially. While effective weed control is an essential aspect of no-till, current herbicide technology may not yet fully achieve this.In northern regions no-till usually allows earlier drilling of winter-sown crops but will give lower soil temperature and higher moisture content in spring, causing delayed drilling of spring-sown crops. No-till soils have greater bulk density and bearing capacity than ploughed soils with a pronounced vertical orientation of macroporosity allowing penetration of roots and water, especially in view of the increased population of deep-burrowing earthworms. Particular care must be taken with no-till to minimise soil damage at harvest and to ensure the even distribution of crop residues prior to drilling.Reduced erosion and runoff after adoption of no-till are widely observed and are of particular importance in southwestern Europe. No-till reduces losses of phosphorus in runoff and, in some cases, reduces the loss of nitrate through leaching. Emissions of greenhouse gases CO 2 and N 2O from no-till soils are highly variable and depend on complex interactions of soil properties. Emission of CO 2 from fuel during machinery usage is always appreciably reduced with no-till. Increased soil organic carbon in surface layers of no-till soils is widely found but may not be associated with increased carbon sequestration throughout the profile. The evaluation of the relative carbon balance for no-till and ploughing depends upon complex inter-relationships between soil and climate factors which are as yet poorly understood. Adoption of no-till could be encouraged by government financial assistance in recognition of environmental benefits, although future restrictions on the use of herbicides may be a deterrent. Opportunities for further research on no-till are outlined. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Global maize production alters an enormous soil organic C (SOC) stock, ultimately affecting greenhouse gas concentrations and the capacity of agroecosystems to buffer climate variability. Inorganic N fertilizer is perhaps the most important factor affecting SOC within maize-based systems due to its effects on crop residue production and SOC mineralization. Using a continuous maize cropping system with a 13 year N fertilizer gradient (0-269 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) that created a large range in crop residue inputs (3.60-9.94 Mg dry matter ha(-1) yr(-1)), we provide the first agronomic assessment of long-term N fertilizer effects on SOC with direct reference to N rates that are empirically determined to be insufficient, optimum, and excessive. Across the N fertilizer gradient, SOC in physico-chemically protected pools was not affected by N fertilizer rate or residue inputs. However, unprotected particulate organic matter (POM) fractions increased with residue inputs. Although N fertilizer was negatively linearly correlated with POM C/N ratios, the slope of this relationship decreased from the least decomposed POM pools (coarse POM) to the most decomposed POM pools (fine intra-aggregate POM). Moreover, C/N ratios of protected pools did not vary across N rates, suggesting little effect of N fertilizer on soil organic matter (SOM) after decomposition of POM. Comparing a N rate within 4\% of agronomic optimum (208 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and an excessive N rate (269 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), there were no differences between SOC amount, SOM C/N ratios, or microbial biomass and composition. These data suggest that excessive N fertilizer had little effect on SOM and they complement agronomic assessments of environmental N losses, that demonstrate N2 O and NO3 emissions exponentially increase when agronomic optimum N is surpassed.},

  abstract = {Patterns in soil N supply in 5 ecosystems in the Noatak National Preserve in Alaska, USA were examined and the potential response of N availability to changes in soil moisture and temperature was studied using 15N pool-dilution techniques. In-field N availability was estimated using ion exchange resin bags and incubation of soil cores in plastic bags. Nitrogen availability was highest in an ecosystem dominated by Alnus crispa and lowest in ecosystems dominated by willows (Salix) or cotton grass tussocks. Repeated watering increased net N mineralization rates by 1.5-3 fold. Net N mineralization at 12 deg C was 5-10 fold greater than at 5 deg C. The interaction between water and temperature was nonsignificant for both net nitrification and net mineralization with the exception of a tundra site. The results suggested that moderate (5 deg C) increases in soil temperature should be expected to substantially increase soil N availability in the short term. Longer term responses may depend on dynamics of litter input and feedback responses within plant and microbial communities.},

  abstract = {The capacity of bacteria and protozoa to mineralize soil nitrogen was studied in microcosms with sterilized soil with or without wheat plants. The effect of small additions of glucose or ammonium nitrate or both, twice a week was also tested. Plant dry weight and N-content, number of microorganisms and biomass plus inorganic N were determined after 6 weeks. The introduction of plants profoundly influenced the N transformations. In the presence of root-derived carbon, much more N was mineralized from the organic matter and immobilized mainly in plant biomass. "Total observable change in biomass N plus inorganic N" was negative in the unvegetated soils without additions, while a mineralization of 1.7 mg N microcosm-1 was observed in microcosms with wheat plants grown with bacteria only. When protozoa were included, the N taken up by plants increased by 75\%. Sugar additions resulted in an 18\% increase of total N in the shoots when protozoa were present, but had no significant effect in the absence of grazers. Plants with the same root weight were more efficient in their uptake of inorganic N when protozoa were present. Plants grown with protozoa also had a lower R/S ratio, indicating a less stressed N availability situation. The lowest ratio was found with N additions in the presence of protozoa. The results indicate that, with energy supplied by plant roots or with external glucose additions, soil bacteria can mineralize N from the soil organic matter to support their own growth. Grazing of the bacteria is necessary to make bacterial biomass N available for plant uptake. ?? 1985.},

  issn = {00167606},
  abstract = {In a headwater catchment in the Oregon Coast Range, we find that solid-phase mass losses due to chemical weathering are equivalent in the bedrock and the soil. However, the long-term rate of mass loss per unit volume of parent rock is greater in the soil than in the rock. We attribute this finding to the effects of biotic processes in the soil and to hydrologic conditions that maximize contact time and water flux through the mineral matrix in the soil. This result stems both from earlier work in which we demonstrated that rock and soil contribute equally to the solute flux and from arguments presented here that the basin is in dynamic equilibrium with respect to erosion and uplift. The silica flux of 10.7 +/- 7.1 tmiddle dotkm-2middle dotyr-1 from the basin is several times larger than the flux from older soils elsewhere, but comparable to the flux from sites with similar physical erosion rates. This result argues that physical denudation or uplift rates play an important role in setting the chemical denudation rate. Physical processes appear to influence chemical-weathering rates in several ways. First, they limit chemical evolution by removing material, thus setting the residence time within the weathered rock and the soil. Second, bioturbation mixes rock fragments into the more reactive soil and maintains high soil porosity, allowing free circulation of water. Because the weathering in the soil is more intense than in the rock, we argue that the chemical denudation rate will diminish where uplift rates-and, hence, physical-denudation rates-are great enough to lead to a bedrock-dominated landscape. Chemical denudation rates will increase with physical-denudation rates, but only as long as the landscape remains mantled by soil.},

  volume = {309},
  issn = {0032079X},
  abstract = {Modelling nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emissions from soil is challenging because multiple biological processes are involved that each respond differently to various environmental and soil factors. Soil water content, organic carbon, temperature and pH are often used in models that predict N(2)O emissions, yet for each of these factors there are concepts that are not fully understood. Though a ubiquitous measure of soil water for models, the application of functions based on water filled pore space across soils that vary in bulk density is not ideal. Diffusion of gases and solutes in soil are controlled by the volume fractions of air and water present. Across soils with different bulk densities, both of these terms vary at constant water filled pore space. Soil organic carbon influences N(2)O emissions in two ways: as a source of energy for denitrifiers and also by driving biological oxygen demand and the creation of anaerobic zones in the soil. Soil temperature influences N(2)O emissions through its effect on the activity of microorganisms and enzymes. A variety of temperature response functions have been proposed. The preferred response function should contain a temperature optimum that can be varied in response to climatic conditions to account for microbial adaptation. Soil pH can have direct and indirect influences on rates and product ratios of nitrification and denitrification. The concepts of pH optima and microbial adaptation need to be considered in modelling. Methodological issues such as microsite versus bulk soil measurements and apportioning N(2)O fluxes to the various N transformation processes remain an impediment to characterising the influence of pH and other factors on N(2)O emissions. Quantifying the response of N(2)O emissions to individual factors using regression analysis requires all other factors to be controlled experimentally. Boundary line analysis provides a way of defining the response to a single input variable where other influencing variables are not controlled. Such analyses can aid in the definition of the shape and magnitude of response functions to be incorporated into process simulation models. Process/mechanistic simulation models offer a greater transferability than empirical models but careful consideration of temporal and spatial scale and the availability of data to run these models is critical in developing model structure.},

  title = {On the Specification of Structural Equation Models for Ecological Systems},
  volume = {80},
  issn = {0012-9615},
  abstract = {The use of structural equation modeling (SEM) is often motivated by its utility for investigating complex networks of relationships, but also because of its promise as a means of representing theoretical concepts using latent variables. In this paper, we discuss characteristics of ecological theory and some of the challenges for proper specification of theoretical ideas in structural equation models (SE models). In our presentation, we describe some of the requirements for classical latent variable models in which observed variables (indicators) are interpreted as the effects of underlying causes. We also describe alternative model specifications in which indicators are interpreted as having causal influences on the theoretical concepts. We suggest that this latter nonclassical specification (which involves another variable type\textemdash{}the composite) will often be appropriate for ecological studies because of the multifaceted nature of our theoretical concepts. In this paper, we employ the use of meta-models to aid the translation of theory into SE models and also to facilitate our ability to relate results back to our theories. We demonstrate our approach by showing how a synthetic theory of grassland biodiversity can be evaluated using SEM and data from a coastal grassland. In this example, the theory focuses on the responses of species richness to abiotic stress and disturbance, both directly and through intervening effects on community biomass. Models examined include both those based on classical forms (where each concept is represented using a single latent variable) and also ones in which the concepts are recognized to be multifaceted and modeled as such. To address the challenge of matching SE models with the conceptual level of our theory, two approaches are illustrated, compositing and aggregation. Both approaches are shown to have merits, with the former being preferable for cases where the multiple facets of a concept have widely differing effects in the system and the latter being preferable where facets act together consistently when influencing other parts of the system. Because ecological theory characteristically deals with concepts that are multifaceted, we expect the methods presented in this paper will be useful for ecologists wishing to use SEM.},

  volume = {52},

  abstract = {In 1995 a working group was assembled at the request of OECD/IPCC/IEA to revise the methodology for N2O from agriculture for the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Methodology. The basics of the methodology developed to calculate annual country level nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural soils is presented herein. Three sources of N2O are distinguished in the new methodology: (i) direct emissions from agricultural soils, (ii) emissions from animal production, and (iii) N2O emissions indirectly induced by agricultural activities. The methodology is a simple approach which requires only input data that are available from FAO databases. The methodology attempts to relate N2O emissions to the agricultural nitrogen (N) cycle and to systems into which N is transported once it leaves agricultural systems. These estimates are made with the realization that increased utilization of crop nutrients, including N, will be required to meet rapidly growing needs for food and fiber production in our immediate future. Anthropogenic N input into agricultural systems include N from synthetic fertilizer, animal wastes, increased biological N-fixation, cultivation of mineral and organic soils through enhanced organic matter mineralization, and mineralization of crop residue returned to the field. Nitrous oxide may be emitted directly to the atmosphere in agricultural fields, animal confinements or pastoral systems or be transported from agricultural systems into ground and surface waters through surface runoff. Nitrate leaching and runoff and food consumption by humans and introduction into sewage systems transport the N ultimately into surface water (rivers and oceans) where additional N2O is produced. Ammonia and oxides of N (NOx) are also emitted from agricultural systems and may be transported off-site and serve to fertilize other systems which leads to enhanced production of N2O. Eventually, all N that moves through the soil system will be either terminally sequestered in buried sediments or denitrified in aquatic systems. We estimated global N2ON emissions for the year 1989, using midpoint emission factors from our methodology and the FAO data for 1989. Direct emissions from agricultural soils totaled 2.1 Tg N, direct emissions from animal production totaled 2.1 Tg N and indirect emissions resulting from agricultural N input into the atmosphere and aquatic systems totaled 2.1 Tg N2ON for an annual total of 6.3 Tg N2ON. The N2O input to the atmosphere from agricultural production as a whole has apparently been previously underestimated. These new estimates suggest that the missing N2O sources discussed in earlier IPCC reports is likely a biogenic (agricultural) one.},

  abstract = {Glacier forefields are ideal ecosystems to study the development of nutrient cycles as well as single turnover processes during soil development. In this study, we examined the ecology of the microbial nitrogen (N) cycle in bulk soil samples from a chronosequence of the Damma glacier, Switzerland. Major processes of the N cycle were reconstructed on the genetic as well as the potential enzyme activity level at sites of the chronosequence that have been ice-free for 10, 50, 70, 120 and 2000 years. In our study, we focused on N fixation, mineralization (chitinolysis and proteolysis), nitrification and denitrification. Our results suggest that mineralization, mainly the decomposition of deposited organic material, was the main driver for N turnover in initial soils, that is, ice-free for 10 years. Transient soils being ice-free for 50 and 70 years were characterized by a high abundance of N fixing microorganisms. In developed soils, ice-free for 120 and 2000 years, significant rates of nitrification and denitrification were measured. Surprisingly, copy numbers of the respective functional genes encoding the corresponding enzymes were already high in the initial phase of soil development. This clearly indicates that the genetic potential is not the driver for certain functional traits in the initial phase of soil formation but rather a well-balanced expression of the respective genes coding for selected functions.

Sequence analysis of the isolates, using D1/D2 domain identified five species of yeasts: Cryptococcus adeliensis (MLB-18 JX192655), Crypto-coccus albidosimilis (MLB-19 JX192656), Cryptococcus saitoi (MLB-22 JX192659), Rhodosporidium lusitaniae (MLB-20 JX192657), and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (MLB-27 JX192664). Effect of temperature on growth of these isolates was studied. The strains are able to grow at temperatures ranging between 1 and 20 \textdegree{}C. Screening of the cultures for amylase, cellulase, protease, lipase, urease and catalase activity were carried out indicating varying amounts of enzyme production at different temperatures. Characterization of lipase in strain Cryptococcus sp. MLB-24 was performed. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis of the cultures grown at four different temperatures (1, 4, 15, and 20 \textdegree{}C) was also done. Decrease in temperature was reported to cause increase in concentration of unsaturated fatty acids. High amount of oleic acid accumulated with increase in temperature. These fatty acids possibly help the strains to survive in glacial ice core cold environment. The extracellular and intracellular filtrate of the cultures showed negative antifreeze protein (AFP) activity. The observations indicate that probably the isolates in the present undertaking adapt to low temperatures, by enzyme and PUFA secretion rather than by antifreeze protein secretion.},

Here we focus on pseudo-profound bullshit, which consists of seemingly impressive assertions that are presented as true and meaningful but are actually vacuous. We presented participants with bullshit statements consisting of buzzwords randomly organized into statements with syntactic structure but no discernible meaning (e.g., ``Wholeness quiets infinite phenomena''). Across multiple studies, the propensity to judge bull- shit statements as profound was associated with a variety of conceptually relevant variables (e.g., intuitive cognitive style, supernatural belief). Parallel associations were less evident among profundity judgments for more conventionally profound (e.g., ``A wet person does not fear the rain'') ormundane (e.g., ``Newborn babies require constant attention'') statements. These results support the idea that some people are more receptive to this type of bullshit and that detecting it is not merely a matter of indiscriminate skepticismbut rather a discernment of deceptive vagueness in otherwise impressive sounding claims. Our re- sults also suggest that a bias toward accepting statements as true may be an important component of pseudo-profound bullshit receptivity.},

  abstract = {Nitrate leaching was studied for 2 years in a structured clay soil (Evesham series) under grass, winter wheat and spring barley at N fertilizer inputs of 135-144 kg ha-1 year-1. Measurements of soil water to 2 m depth by neutron probe showed that the year could be divided into well defined periods of deficit, separated by a period when the soil was at its winter mean water content. Soil water potentials showed very little gradient for water flow below 1 m, and a persistent convergent zero flux plane at 40-60 cm depth during the autumn wetting-up period (September-November). Nitrate concentration in the drainage increased with discharge rates up to 3-6 mm day-1. Mean nitrate concentrations were generally highest during intermittent drain-flow in the autumn. Of the total N leached over the 2 years, 23 to 28\% (5-7 kg N ha-1) was lost during this period. The remainder (13-25 kg N ha-1) was leached during winter and virtually no N was lost in the following spring-early summer. This seasonal pattern of N leaching was interpreted in terms of intermittent flow during rainfall of nitrate-rich water from surface layers, which bypassed the relatively dry soil matrix at 40-60 cm, but was intercepted by natural and artificial drainage channels. Implications for the prediction of N leaching loss based on the concept of excess winter rainfall are discussed. When predicting the start of N leaching in structured clay soils, the soil water status should be assessed from measurements of water potential rather than water content. ?? 1983.},

These treatments reduced the amounts of nitrate-N by between 10\textendash{}20 kg ha-1 thereby lowering the potential for leaching and gaseous N losses. However, uptake of N by overwintering crops was low, reflecting the short day-lengths and low soil temperatures associated with this part of Britain. Vegetation that had regenerated naturally was as effective as sown cover crops at taking up N over winter and in returning N to the soil for the following crop. Incorporation of residues generally resulted in lower mineralisation rates and reduced N2O emissions than the cultivation of bare ground, indicating a temporary immobilisation of soil N following incorporation. Emissions from incorporated cover crops ranged from 23\textendash{}44 g N2O-N ha-1 over 19 days, compared with 61 g N2O-N ha-1 emitted from bare ground. Emissions from incorporated green manures ranged from 409\textendash{}580 g N2O-N ha-1 over 53days with 462 gN2O-N ha-1 emitted from bare ground.

There was no significant effect of either cover cropping or green manuring on theNcontent or yield of the subsequent oats crop, suggesting that N was not sufficiently limiting in this soil for any benefits to become apparent immediately.

The intramolecular (15)N site preference (SP) of N2O could provide a tool to distinguish between N2O produced by bacteria or fungi, since in previous studies fungi exhibited much higher SP values than bacteria.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nMETHODS: To further constrain isotopic evidence of fungal denitrification, we incubated six soil fungal strains under denitrifying conditions, with either NO3(-) or NO2(-) as the electron acceptor, and measured the isotopic signature ({$\delta$}(18)O, {$\delta$}(15)Nbulk and SP values) of the N2O produced. The nitrogen isotopic fractionation was calculated and the oxygen isotope exchange associated with particular fungal enzymes was estimated.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nRESULTS: Five fungi of the order Hypocreales produced N2O with a SP of 35.1\,{$\pm$}\,1.7 \textperthousand{} after 7\,days of anaerobic incubation independent of the electron acceptor, whereas one Sordariales species produced N2O from NO2(-) only, with a SP value of 21.9\,{$\pm$}\,1.4 \textperthousand. Smaller isotope effects of (15)Nbulk were associated with larger N2O production. The {$\delta$}(18)O values were influenced by oxygen exchange between water and denitrification intermediates, which occurred primarily at the nitrite reduction step.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that SP of N2O is a promising tool to differentiate between fungal and bacterial N2O from denitrification. Modelling of oxygen isotope fractionation processes indicated that the contribution of the NO2(-) and NO reduction steps to the total oxygen exchange differed among the various fungal species studied. However, more information is needed about different biological orders of fungi as they may differ in denitrification enzymes and consequently in the SP and {$\delta$}(18)O values of the N2O produced.},

  abstract = {Organic farming has been identified as promoting soil quality even though tillage is used for weed suppression. Adopting zero tillage and other conservation tillage practices can enhance soil quality in cropping systems where synthetic agri-chemicals are relied on for crop nutrition and weed control. Attempts have been made to eliminate tillage completely when growing several field crops organically. Vegetative mulch produced by killed cover crops in organic zero tillage systems can suppress annual weeds, but large amounts are needed for adequate early season weed control. Established perennial weeds are not controlled by cover crop mulch. Integrated weed management strategies that include other cultural as well as biological and mechanical controls have potential and need to be incorporated into organic zero tillage research efforts. Market crop performance in organic zero tillage systems has been mixed because of weed, nutrient cycling, and other problems that still must be solved. Soil quality benefits have been demonstrated in comparisons between organic conservation tillage and inversion tillage systems, but studies that include zero tillage treatments are lacking. Research is needed which identifies agronomic strategies for optimum market crop performance, acceptable levels of weed suppression, and soil quality benefits following adoption of organic zero tillage.},

  abstract = {We tested a method of estimating the activity of detectable individual bacterial and archaeal OTUs within a community by calculating ratios of absolute 16S rRNA to rDNA copy numbers. We investigated phylogenetically coherent patterns of activity among soil prokaryotes in non-growing soil communities. 'Activity ratios' were calculated for bacteria and archaea in soil sampled from a tropical rainforest and temperate agricultural field and incubated for one year at two levels of moisture availability and with and without carbon additions. Prior to calculating activity ratios, we corrected the relative abundances of OTUs to account for multiple copies of the 16S gene per genome. Although necessary to ensure accurate activity ratios, this correction did not change our interpretation of differences in microbial community composition across treatments. Activity ratios in this study were lower than those previously published (0.0003-210, logarithmic mean. =. 0.24), suggesting significant extracellular DNA preservation. After controlling for the influence of individual incubation jars, significant differences in activity ratios between all members of each phylum were observed. Planctomycetes and Firmicutes had the highest activity ratios and Crenarchaeota had the lowest activity overall. Our results suggest that greater caution should be taken in interpreting soil microbial community data derived from extracted DNA. Indirect extraction methods may be useful in ensuring that microbes identified from extracellular DNA are not erroneously interpreted as components of an active microbial community.},

A 1.8 angstrom crystal structure of Csy4 bound to its cognate RNA reveals that Csy4 makes sequence-specific interactions in the major groove of the crRNA repeat stem-loop. Together with electrostatic contacts to the phosphate backbone, these enable Csy4 to bind selectively and cleave pre-crRNAs using phylogenetically conserved serine and histidine residues in the active site. The RNA recognition mechanism identified here explains sequence- and structure-specific processing by a large family of CRISPR-specific endoribonucleases. I},

  volume = {6},
  issn = {17520894},
  abstract = {Methane is an important greenhouse gas, responsible for about 20\% of the warming induced by long-lived greenhouse gases since pre-industrial times. By reacting with hydroxyl radicals, methane reduces the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere and generates ozone in the troposphere. Although most sources and sinks of methane have been identified, their relative contributions to atmospheric methane levels are highly uncertain. As such, the factors responsible for the observed stabilization of atmospheric methane levels in the early 2000s, and the renewed rise after 2006, remain unclear. Here, we construct decadal budgets for methane sources and sinks between 1980 and 2010, using a combination of atmospheric measurements and results from chemical transport models, ecosystem models, climate chemistry models and inventories of anthropogenic emissions. The resultant budgets suggest that data-driven approaches and ecosystem models overestimate total natural emissions. We build three contrasting emission scenarios \textemdash{} which differ in fossil fuel and microbial emissions \textemdash{} to explain the decadal variability in atmospheric methane levels detected, here and in previous studies, since 1985. Although uncertainties in emission trends do not allow definitive conclusions to be drawn, we show that the observed stabilization of methane levels between 1999 and 2006 can potentially be explained by decreasing-to-stable fossil fuel emissions, combined with stable-to-increasing microbial emissions. We show that a rise in natural wetland emissions and fossil fuel emissions probably accounts for the renewed increase in global methane levels after 2006, although the relative contribution of these two sources remains uncertain.},

  volume = {7},
  issn = {17264170},
  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a trace gas that contributes to the greenhouse effect and stratospheric ozone depletion. The N2O yield from nitrification (moles N2O-N produced per mole ammonium-N consumed) has been used to esti- mate marine N2O production rates from measured nitrifi- cation rates and global estimates of oceanic export produc- tion. However, the N2O yield from nitrification is not con- stant. Previous culture-based measurements indicate that N2O yield increases as oxygen (O2) concentration decreases and as nitrite (NO- 2 ) concentration increases. Here, we have measured yields of N2O from cultures of the marine {$\beta$}- proteobacterium Nitrosomonas marina C-113a as they grew on low-ammonium (50{$\mathrm{\mu}$}M) media. These yields, which were typically between 4\texttimes{}10-4 and 7\texttimes{}10-4 for cultures with cell densities between 2\texttimes{}102 and 2.1\texttimes{}104 cells ml-1, were lower than previous reports for ammonia-oxidizing bacte- ria. The observed impact of O2 concentration on yield was also smaller than previously reported under all conditions except at high starting cell densities (1.5\texttimes{}106 cells ml-1), where 160-fold higher yields were observed at 0.5\% O2 (5.1{$\mathrm{\mu}$}M dissolved O2) compared with 20\% O2 (203{$\mathrm{\mu}$}M dis- solved O2). At lower cell densities (2\texttimes{}102 and 2.1\texttimes{}104 cells ml-1), cultures grown under 0.5\% O2 had yields that were only 1.25- to 1.73-fold higher than cultures grown un- der 20\% O2. Thus, previously reported many-fold increases in N2O yield with dropping O2 could be reproduced only at cell densities that far exceeded those of ammonia oxidizers in the ocean. The presence of excess NO- 2 (up to 1mM) in the growth medium also increased N2O yields by an average of 70\% to 87\% depending onO2 concentration. We made stable isotopic measurements on N2O from these cultures to iden- tify the biochemical mechanisms behind variations in N2O yield. Based on measurements of {$\delta$}15Nbulk, site preference (SP={$\delta$}15N{$\alpha$}\textendash{} {$\delta$}15N{$\beta$}), and {$\delta$}18OofN2O({$\delta$}18O-N2O), we esti- mate that nitrifier-denitrification produced between 11\% and 26\% of N2O from cultures grown under 20\% O2 and 43\% to 87\% under 0.5\% O2. We also demonstrate that a posi- tive correlation between SP and {$\delta$}18O-N2O is expected when nitrifying bacteria produce N2O. A positive relationship be- tween SP and {$\delta$}18O-N2Ohas been observed in environmental N2O datasets, but until now, explanations for the observation invoked only denitrification. Such interpretations may over- estimate the role of heterotrophic denitrification and underes- timate the role of ammonia oxidation in environmental N2O production. 1},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) deposition is impacting the services that ecosystems provide to humanity. However, the mechanisms determining impacts on the N cycle are not fully understood. To explore the mechanistic underpinnings of N impacts on N cycle processes, we reviewed and synthesised recent progress in ecosystem N research through empirical studies, conceptual analysis and model simulations. Experimental and observational studies have revealed that the stimulation of plant N uptake and soil retention generally diminishes as N loading increases, while dissolved and gaseous losses of N occur at low N availability but increase exponentially and become the dominant fate of N at high loading rates. The original N saturation hypothesis emphasises sequential N saturation from plant uptake to soil retention before N losses occur. However, biogeochemical models that simulate simultaneous competition for soil N substrates by multiple processes match the observed patterns of N losses better than models based on sequential competition. To enable better prediction of terrestrial N cycle responses to N loading, we recommend that future research identifies the response functions of different N processes to substrate availability using manipulative experiments, and incorporates the measured N saturation response functions into conceptual, theoretical and quantitative analyses.},

  abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs). Variation in soil moisture can be very dynamic, and it is one of the dominant factors controlling the net exchange of these three GHGs. Although technologies for high-frequency, precise measurements of CO2 have been available for years, methods for measuring soil fluxes of CH4 and N2O at high temporal frequency have been hampered by lack of appropriate technology for in situ real-time measurements. A previously developed automated chamber system for measuring CO2 flux from soils was configured to run in line with a new quantum cascade laser (QCLAS) instrument that measures N2O and CH4. Here we present data from a forested wetland in Maine and an agricultural field in North Dakota, which provided examples of both net uptake and production for N2O and CH4. The objective was to provide a range of conditions in which to run the new system and to compare results to a traditional manual static-chamber method. The high-precision and more-than-10-times-lower minimum detectable flux of the QCLAS system, compared to the manual system, provided confidence in measurements of small N2O uptake in the forested wetland. At the agricultural field, the greatest difference between the automated and manual sampling systems came from the effect of the relatively infrequent manual sampling of the high spatial variation, or "hot spots", in GHG fluxes. Hot spots greatly influenced the seasonal estimates, particularly for N2O, over one 74-day alfalfa crop cycle. The high temporal frequency of the automated system clearly characterized the transient response of all three GHGs to precipitation and demonstrated a clear diel pattern related to temperature for GHGs. A combination of high-frequency automated and spatially distributed chambers would be ideal for characterizing hot spots and "hot moments" of GHG fluxes.},

  abstract = {No-tillage (NT), a practice that has been shown to increase carbon sequestration in soils, has resulted in contradictory effects on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Moreover, it is not clear how mitigation practices for N2O emission reduction, such as applying nitrogen (N) fertilizer according to soil N reserves and matching the time of application to crop uptake, interact with NT practices. N2O fluxes from two management systems [conventional (CP), and best management practices: NT1reduced fertilizer (BMP)] applied to a corn (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max L.), winter-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation in Ontario, Canada, were measured from January 2000 to April 2005, using a micrometeorological method. The superimposition of interannual variability of weather and management resulted in mean monthly N2O fluxes ranging from 1.9 to 61.3 gNha1 day1. Mean annual N2O emissions over the 5-year period decreased significantly by 0.79 from 2.19 kgNha1 for CP to 1.41 kgNha1 for BMP. Growing season (May\textendash{}October) N2O emissions were reduced on average by 0.16 kgNha1 (20\% of total reduction), and this decrease only occurred in the corn year of the rotation. Nongrowing season (November\textendash{}April) emissions, comprised between 30\% and 90\% of the annual emissions, mostly due to increased N2O fluxes during soil thawing. These emissions were well correlated (r250.90) to the accumulated degree-hours below 0 1C at 5 cm depth, a measure of duration and intensity of soil freezing. Soil management in BMP (NT) significantly reduced N2O emissions during thaw (80\% of total reduction) by reducing soil freezing due to the insulating effects of the larger snow cover plus corn and wheat residue during winter. In conclusion, significant reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions can be obtained when NT is combined with a strategy that matches N application rate and timing to crop needs.},

Recent studies have shown, however, that the presence of understory vegetation can increase soil carbon and nutrient content, especially where N-fixing species are present. To investigate whether this response can be attributed to changes in soil microbial communities, we conducted experiments with isotopically-labeled litter in Pinus ponderosa stands where N-fixing understory species were present (UP) or absent (UA). We measured carbon and nutrient stocks and monitored changes in soil microbial biomass and composition. Field and laboratory experiments strongly suggest that understory suppression and relatively small changes in litter quality can yield significant changes in soil C and N stocks, which are critical to maintaining forest productivity. We detected a greater accumulation of carbon and nitrogen (relative to controls) when mixtures of pine and N-rich litter were applied to the soil. In contrast, soils amended only with pine litter showed a net loss of carbon and nitrogen stocks. Soil microbial biomass was significantly higher in UP than in UA stands and microbial community composition varied with type of litter inputs and incubation time (0\textendash{}180 days), but not as a function of understory management. Similar results were obtained from field experiments, in which mesocosms were incubated for {$\sim$}2.5 years with pine and N-rich understory litter mixtures. The suppression of understory species caused a decline in litter-derived carbon and nitrogen in the soil, even when the microbial community was resilient to the imposed treatments.},

It leads to the production of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) as an intermediate and possible end product. It is not known how important nitrifier denitrification is for the production of N2O in soils. We explored N2O production by nitrifier denitrification in relation to other N2O producing processes such as nitrification and denitrification under different soil conditions. The influence of aeration of the soil, different N sources, and pH were tested in four experiments. To differentiate between sources of N2O, an incubation method with inhibitors was used [Biol. Fertil. Soils 22 (1996) 331]. Sets of four incubations included controls without addition of inhibitors, incubations with addition of small concentrations of C2H2 (0.01-0.1kPa), large concentrations of O2 (100kPa), or a combination of C2H2 and O2. The results indicate that the availability of NO2 - stimulated the apparent N 2O production by nitrifier denitrification. A decreasing O 2 content increased the total N2O production, but decreased N2O production by nitrifier denitrification. No significant effect of pH could be found. The study revealed problems concerning the use of the inhibitors C2H2 and O2. Almost one-third of all incubations with inhibitors produced more N2O than the controls. Possible reasons for the problems are discussed. The inhibitors C2H2 and O2 need to be tested thoroughly for their effects on different N2O producing processes before further application. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Biological denitrification is affected by many environmental factors that control the amount of N-2 and N-20 entering the atmosphere. This study was conducted to measure the effect on water-filled pore space (WFPS), available C, and soil NO-3 concentration on total denitrification (N-2 + N-2O), using acetylene (C-2H-2) inhibition, and to ascertain if denitrification could be estimated from N-2O measurements in the field using an average N-2/N-2O ratio. Repacked cores of four bench-mark soils were brought to 60, 75, and 90\% WFPS by applying treatments of glucose-C (0, 180, and 360 kg ha-1) and NO-3-N (0, 50, and 100 kg ha-1). The cores were incubated at 25 degree C, with and without 100 mL C-2H-2 L-1, for 5 d during which daily gas samples of the headspace were analyzed for N-2O and CO-2. Total N loss due to denitrification generally increased as soil texture became finer and WFPS increased. The only exception to this was the C-amended sand, where N losses up to 26 and 66\% were recorded at 60 and 75\% WFPS, respectively. Denitrification rates of high N concentrations were quite small in the absence of an available C source but increased with increasing available C (glucose). The N-2/N-2O ratio generally increased with time of incubation after the initial treatment application. The largest ratios (up to 549) were found at the highest available C rate and generally at the highest soil water content. The presence of high NO-3 concentrations apparently inhibited the conversion of N-2O to N-2, resulting in lower N-2/N-2O ratios. Using an average N-2/N-2O ratio for estimation of denitrification from N-2O field measurements cannot be recommended because of the variation in this ratio due to the many environmental factors altered by field management that influence denitrification and the relative production of N-2 and N-2O.},

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) is an environmentally important atmospheric trace gas because it is an effective greenhouse gas and it leads to ozone depletion through photo-chemical nitric oxide (NO) production in the stratosphere. Mitigating its steady increase in atmospheric concentration requires an understanding of the mechanisms that lead to its formation in natural and engineered microbial communities. N(2)O is formed biologically from the oxidation of hydroxylamine (NH(2)OH) or the reduction of nitrite (NO(-) (2)) to NO and further to N(2)O. Our review of the biological pathways for N(2)O production shows that apparently all organisms and pathways known to be involved in the catabolic branch of microbial N-cycle have the potential to catalyze the reduction of NO(-) (2) to NO and the further reduction of NO to N(2)O, while N(2)O formation from NH(2)OH is only performed by ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB). In addition to biological pathways, we review important chemical reactions that can lead to NO and N(2)O formation due to the reactivity of NO(-) (2), NH(2)OH, and nitroxyl (HNO). Moreover, biological N(2)O formation is highly dynamic in response to N-imbalance imposed on a system. Thus, understanding NO formation and capturing the dynamics of NO and N(2)O build-up are key to understand mechanisms of N(2)O release. Here, we discuss novel technologies that allow experiments on NO and N(2)O formation at high temporal resolution, namely NO and N(2)O microelectrodes and the dynamic analysis of the isotopic signature of N(2)O with quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy (QCLAS). In addition, we introduce other techniques that use the isotopic composition of N(2)O to distinguish production pathways and findings that were made with emerging molecular techniques in complex environments. Finally, we discuss how a combination of the presented tools might help to address important open questions on pathways and controls of nitrogen flow through complex microbial communities that eventually lead to N(2)O build-up.},

Biological processes such as nitrification and denitrification are thought to drive nitrous oxide production in soils, which comprise the largest source of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere1. Here we present measurements of the concentration and isotopic composition of nitrous oxide in soil pore spaces in samples taken near Don Juan Pond, a metabolically dormant hypersaline pond in Southern Victoria Land, Antarctica in 2006, 2007 and 2008, together with in situ fluxes of nitrous oxide from the soil to the atmosphere. We find fluxes of nitrous oxide that rival those measured in fertilized tropical soils3. Laboratory experimentsin which nitrite-rich brine was reacted with a variety of minerals containing Fe(II)reveal a new mechanism of abiotic waterrock reaction that could support nitrous oxide fluxes at Don Juan Pond. Our findings illustrate a dynamic and unexpected link between the geosphere and atmosphere.},

Seventeen plant species were undersown in spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) to study their suitability regarding establishment, biomass production, competition with the main crop and effects on soil mineral N. Three different seeding rates were evaluated. Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) decreased nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) content in late autumn and timothy (Phleum pratense L.) in the succeeding spring. A mixture was optimal to reduce N leaching. Italian ryegrass is a very competitive species that should be undersown at moderate seeding rates to avoid large yield reduction in the main crop. Black medic (Medicago lupulina L.) slightly increased N leaching risk, but red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) did not increase soil NO3-N content. As clovers did not compete strongly with the main crop, fairly high seeding rates can be used to maximise N fixation to benefit the successive crop. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Denitrification removes ecologically available nitrogen (N) from the biosphere and influences both the pace and magnitude of global climate change. Disagreements exist over the degree to which this microbial process influences N-availability patterns across Earth's ecosystems. We combine natural stable isotope methods with qPCR to investigate how denitrifier gene abundance is related to variations in nitrate (NO3-) pool sizes across diverse terrestrial biomes and conditions. We analyze NO3- isotope composition (15N/14N, 18O/16O) and denitrifier gene nirS in 52 soil samples from different California ecosystems, spanning desert, chaparral, oak-woodland/savanna and forest. {$\delta$}15N-NO3- correlates positively with {$\delta$}18O-NO3- (P{$\leqslant$}0.03) and nirS abundance (P = 0.00002) across sites, revealing the widespread importance of isotopic discrimination by soil denitrifiers. Furthermore, NO3- concentrations correlate negatively to nirS (P = 0.002) and {$\delta$}15N-NO3- (P = 0.003) across sites. We also observe these spatial relationships in short-term (7-day), in situ soil-incubation experiments; NO3--depletion strongly corresponds with increased nirS, nirS/16 rRNA, and enrichment of heavy NO3- isotopes over time. Overall, these findings suggest that microbial denitrification can consume plant-available NO3- to low levels at multiple time scales, contributing to N-limitation patterns across sites, particularly in moist, carbon-rich soils. Furthermore, our study provides a new approach for understanding the relationships between microbial gene abundance and terrestrial ecosystem functioning.},

  issn = {0032-079X, 1573-5036},
  abstract = {Crop and livestock agricultural production systems are important contributors to local, regional and global budgets of NH3, NOx (NO + NO2) and N2O. Emissions of NH3 and NOx (which are biologically and chemically active) into the atmosphere serve to redistribute fixed N to local and regional aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems that may otherwise be disconnected from the sources of the N gases. The emissions of NOx also contribute to local elevated ozone concentrations while N2O emissions contribute to global greenhouse gas accumulation and to stratospheric ozone depletion. Ammonia is the major gaseous base in the atmosphere and serves to neutralize about 30\% of the hydrogen ions in the atmosphere. Fifty to 75\% of the {$\approx$} 55 Tg N yr-1 NH3 from terrestrial systems is emitted from animal and crop-based agriculture from animal excreta and synthetic fertilizer application. About half of the 50 Tg N yr-1 of NOx emitted from the earth surface annually arises from fossil fuel combustion and the remainder from biomass burning and emissions from soil. The NOx emitted, principally as nitric oxide (NO), reacts rapidly in the atmosphere and in a complex cycle with light, ozone and hydrocarbons, and produces nitric acid and particulate nitrate. These materials can interact with plants and the soil locally or be transported form the site and interact with atmospheric particulate to form aerosols. These salts and aerosols return to fertilize terrestrial and aquatic systems in wet and dry deposition. A small fraction of this N may be biologically converted to N2O. About 5\% of the total atmospheric greenhouse effect is attributed to N2O from which 70\% of the annual global anthropogenic emissions come from animal and crop production. The coupling of increased population with a move of a large sector of the world population to diets that require more energy and N input, will lead to continued increases in anthropogenic input into the global N cycle. This scenario suggests that emissions of NH3, NOx and N2O from agricultural systems will continue to increase and impact global terrestrial and aquatic systems, even those far removed from agricultural production, to an ever growing extent, unless N resources are used more efficiently or food consumption trends change.},

  abstract = {Paracoccus denitrificans and its near relative Paracoccus versutus (formerly known as Thiobacillus versutus) have been attracting increasing attention because the aerobic respiratory system of P. denitrificans has long been regarded as a model for that of the mitochondrion, with which there are many components (e.g., cytochrome aa(3) oxidase) in common. Members of the genus exhibit a great range of metabolic flexibility, particularly with respect to processes involving respiration. Prominent examples of flexibility are the use in denitrification of nitrate, nitrite, nitrous oxide, and nitric oxide as alternative electron acceptors to oxygen and the ability to use C-1 compounds (e.g., methanol and methylamine) as electron donors to the respiratory chains. The proteins required for these respiratory processes are not constitutive, and the underlying complex regulatory systems that regulate their expression are beginning to be unraveled. There has been uncertainty about whether. transcription in a member of the alpha-3 Proteobacteria such as P. denitrificans involves a conventional sigma(70)-type RNA polymerase, especially since canonical -35 and -10 DNA binding sites have not been readily identified. In this review, we argue that many genes, in particular those encoding constitutive proteins, may be under the control of a sigma(70) RNA polymerase very closely related to that of Rhodobacter capsulatus. While the main focus is on the structure and regulation of genes coding for products involved in respiratory processes in Paracoccus, the current state of knowledge of the components of such respiratory pathways, and their biogenesis, is also reviewed.},

  abstract = {Although projections of precipitation change indicate increases in variability, most studies of impacts of climate change on ecosystems focused on effects of changes in amount of precipitation, overlooking precipitation variability effects, especially at the interannual scale. Here, we present results from a 6-y field experiment, where we applied sequences of wet and dry years, increasing interannual precipitation coefficient of variation while maintaining a precipitation amount constant. Increased precipitation variability significantly reduced ecosystem primary production. Dominant plant-functional types showed opposite responses: perennial-grass productivity decreased by 81\%, whereas shrub productivity increased by 67\%. This pattern was explained by different nonlinear responses to precipitation. Grass productivity presented a saturating response to precipitation where dry years had a larger negative effect than the positive effects of wet years. In contrast, shrubs showed an increasing response to precipitation that resulted in an increase in average productivity with increasing precipitation variability. In addition, the effects of precipitation variation increased through time. We argue that the differential responses of grasses and shrubs to precipitation variability and the amplification of this phenomenon through time result from contrasting root distributions of grasses and shrubs and competitive interactions among plant types, confirmed by structural equation analysis. Under drought conditions, grasses reduce their abundance and their ability to absorb water that then is transferred to deep soil layers that are exclusively explored by shrubs. Our work addresses an understudied dimension of climate change that might lead to widespread shrub encroachment reducing the provisioning of ecosystem services to society.},

  abstract = {Arsenic contamination of rice is widespread, but the rhizosphere processes influencing arsenic attenuation remain unresolved. In particular, the formation of Fe plaque around rice roots is thought to be an important barrier to As uptake, but the relative importance of this mechanism is not well characterized. Here we elucidate the colocalization of As species and Fe on rice roots with variable Fe coatings; we used a combination of techniques--X-ray fluorescence imaging, {$\mu$}XANES, transmission X-ray microscopy, and tomography--for this purpose. Two dominant As species were observed in fine roots-inorganic As(V) and As(III) -with minor amounts of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and arsenic trisglutathione (AsGlu(3)). Our investigation shows that variable Fe plaque formation affects As entry into rice roots. In roots with Fe plaque, As and Fe were strongly colocated around the root; however, maximal As and Fe were dissociated and did not encapsulate roots that had minimal Fe plaque. Moreover, As was not exclusively associated with Fe plaque in the rice root system; Fe plaque does not coat many of the young roots or the younger portion of mature roots. Young, fine roots, important for solute uptake, have little to no iron plaque. Thus, Fe plaque does not directly intercept (and hence restrict) As supply to and uptake by rice roots but rather serves as a bulk scavenger of As predominantly near the root base.},

Anthropogenic inputs of nutrients to the Earth's surface and atmosphere have increased greatly during the past two centuries. This nutrient enrichment, or eutrophication, can lead to highly undesirable changes in ecosystem structure and function, however. In this paper we briefly review the process, the impacts, and the potential management of cultural eutrophication in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems. We present two brief case studies (one freshwater and one marine) demonstrating that nutrient loading restriction is the essential cornerstone of aquatic eutrophication control. In addition, we present results of a preliminary statistical analysis that is consistent with the hypothesis that anthropogenic emissions of oxidized nitrogen could be influencing atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide via nitrogen stimulation of global primary production.},

The origins of the microbiota were investigated by examining correlations to molecular data obtained from marine, soil, freshwater and atmospheric environments and geochemical analytes measured in the snow. Snow was found to contain a diverse assemblage of bacteria (Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria) and eukarya (Alveolata, Fungi, Stramenopiles and Chloroplastida). Phylotypes related to archaeal Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota phyla were also identified. The snow microbial assemblages were more similar to communities characterized in soil than to those documented in marine ecosystems. Despite this, the chemical composition of snow samples was consistent with a marine contribution, and strong correlations existed between bacterial beta diversity and the concentration of Na(+) and Cl(-) . These results suggest that surface snow from western regions of Greenland contains exogenous microbiota that were likely aerosolized from more distant soil sources, transported in the atmosphere and co-precipitated with the snow.},

  abstract = {The metacommunity concept is an important way to think about linkages between different spatial scales in ecology. Here we review current understanding about this concept. We first investigate issues related to its definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

  abstract = {The Amazon rainforest, the largest equatorial forest in the world, is being cleared for pasture and agricultural use at alarming rates. Tropical deforestation is known to cause alterations in microbial communities at taxonomic and phylogenetic levels, but it is unclear whether microbial functional groups are altered. We asked whether free-living nitrogen-fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs) respond to deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, using analysis of the marker gene nifH. Clone libraries were generated from soil samples collected from a primary forest, a 5-year-old pasture originally converted from primary forest, and a secondary forest established after pasture abandonment. Although diazotroph richness did not significantly change among the three plots, diazotroph community composition was altered with forest-to-pasture conversion, and phylogenetic similarity was higher among pasture communities than among those in forests. There was also 10-fold increase in nifH gene abundance following conversion from primary forest to pasture. Three environmental factors were associated with the observed changes: soil acidity, total N concentration, and C/N ratio. Our results suggest a partial restoration to initial levels of abundance and community structure of diazotrophs following pasture abandonment, with primary and secondary forests sharing similar communities. We postulate that the response of diazotrophs to land use change is a direct consequence of changes in plant communities, particularly the higher N demand of pasture plant communities for supporting aboveground plant growth.},

  volume = {189},
  issn = {01678809},
  abstract = {Crop yields are influenced by multiple, interacting factors, making it challenging to determine how specific management practices and crop rotations affect agroecosystem productivity. This is especially true in cropping systems experiments in which multiple management practices differ between experimental cropping system treatments. We conducted a cropping systems experiment in central Pennsylvania, USA, to analyze the effects of initial cover crop and tillage intensity on feed grain and forage crop productivity during the transition to organic production. We hypothesized that treatment effects of (1) tillage intensity (full or reduced); and (2) initial cover crops (annual rye (Secale cereale) or timothy/clover (Phleum pratense/Trifolium pratense)) on grain crop yield in a 3-year cover crop/soybean (Glycine max)/corn (Zea mays) rotation would be mediated by key agroecosystem function indicators (soil quality, weed pressure, and predatory arthropod activity). We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to attribute yield variation to treatment effects and abiotic factors as mediated by these ecosystem functions. We found that tillage intensity had both direct and indirect effects on corn yields. Full tillage had a direct, positive effect on corn yields, a negative effect on perennial weed density, and negative effect on a soil quality indicator (labile soil carbon). Full tillage also had an indirect effect on corn yields as mediated by perennial weed density. The initial cover crop influenced predatory arthropod activity-density and perennial weeds in year 2 (soybean phase), but had no effects in year 3 (corn phase). Abiotic and site factors influenced crop yields and other ecosystem functions in both rotation years. Our results highlight the utility of analytical approaches that consider the relationships among agroecosystem components. Through the analysis of management effects on multiple ecosystem functions, our results indicate that managing weed populations through tillage in organic systems can have the strongest effect on crop yields, although short-term profit gains may be at the expense of long-term loss in soil quality and beneficial insect conservation. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  title = {Minimizing Artifacts and Biases in Chamber-Based Measurements of Soil Respiration},
  volume = {113},
  issn = {01681923},
  abstract = {Soil respiration is one of the largest and most important fluxes of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems. While eddy covariance methods are becoming widely used to measure nighttime total ecosystem respiration, the use of chambers placed over the soil is the most direct way of measuring respiration occurring within the soil and litter layers. Several decades of experience with chamber-based measurements have revealed most of the potential sources of error with this methodology. The objectives of this paper are to review several recently expressed concerns about uncertainties of chamber-based measurements of CO2 emissions from soils, to evaluate the direction and magnitude of these potential errors, and explain procedures that minimize these errors and biases. Disturbance of diffusion gradients cause underestimate of fluxes by less than 15\% in most cases, and can be partially corrected for with curve fitting and/or can be minimized by using brief measurement periods. Underpressurization or overpressurization of the chamber caused by flow restrictions in air circulating designs can cause large errors, but can also be avoided with properly sized chamber vents and unrestricted flows. We found very small pressure differentials (??0.1 Pa) and modest (???15\%), inconsistent errors in flux estimates using our chamber design. Somewhat larger pressure differentials (??0.9 Pa) were observed under windy conditions, and the accuracy of chamber-based measurements made under such conditions needs more research. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity can be addressed with appropriate chamber sizes and numbers and frequency of sampling. For example, means of eight randomly chosen flux measurements from a population of 36 measurements made with 300 cm2 diameter chambers in tropical forests and pastures were within 25\% of the full population mean 98\% of the time and were within 10\% of the full population mean 70\% of the time. Finally, comparisons of chamber-based measurements with tower-based measurements require analysis of the scale of variation within the purported tower footprint. In a forest at Howland, ME, soil respiration rates differed by a factor of 2 between very poorly drained and well drained soils, but these differences were mostly fortuitously cancelled when spatially extrapolated over purported footprints of 600-2100 m length. While all of these potential sources of measurement error and sampling biases must be carefully considered, properly designed and deployed chambers provide a reliable means of accurately measuring soil respiration in terrestrial ecosystems. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Rivers and streams constitute a major pathway for material transport from land to sea and an important source of greenhouse gases. Short-term variation in stream chemistry due to day-night oxygen \{(O-2)\} fluctuations could significantly affect a stream's capacity to transport nutrients and produce greenhouse gases. Though it is well established that diel cycles are important in controlling O-2 and \{CO2\} dynamics, the study of diel dynamics of other redox-sensitive elements has been fairly limited. Here we show that a subtropical stream can undergo complete reduction and oxidation sequences in just a few hours. This redox fluctuation has important consequences for downstream transfer of nutrients and for greenhouse gas production. Among these consequences are decreased denitrification rates relative to estimates made using only daytime measurements (17-38\% during our observation period), increased downstream nitrogen \{(N)\} transfer, a striking change in form of transported N (decreased nitrate and increased ammonium), and decreased estimates of in-stream nitrous oxide \{(N2O)\} flux (36-38\% during our observation period). Additionally, methane \{(CH4)\} concentrations doubled and carbon dioxide \{(CO2)\} concentrations rose from 4.6 to 30.7 mg L-1 during the 24-hour period of our observations. Diel shifts like the one we describe have implications for our understanding of nutrient transport and greenhouse gas production in eutrophied streams.},

Until recently, similar studies were impossible for microorganisms, arguably the most diverse and abundant group of organisms on Earth. Here, we present a continental-scale description of soil bacterial communities and the environmental factors influencing their biodiversity. We collected 98 soil samples from across North and South America and used a ribosomal DNA-fingerprinting method to compare bacterial community composition and diversity quantitatively across sites. Bacterial diversity was unrelated to site temperature, latitude, and other variables that typically predict plant and animal diversity, and community composition was largely independent of geographic distance. The diversity and richness of soil bacterial communities differed by ecosystem type, and these differences could largely be explained by soil pH (r(2) = 0.70 and r(2) = 0.58, respectively; P  0.0001 in both cases). Bacterial diversity was highest in neutral soils and lower in acidic soils, with soils from the Peruvian Amazon the most acidic and least diverse in our study. Our results suggest that microbial biogeography is controlled primarily by edaphic variables and differs fundamentally from the biogeography of "macro" organisms.},

  abstract = {Agricultural intensification has greatly increased the productive capacity of agroecosystems, but has had unintended environmental consequences including degradation of soil and water resources, and alteration of biogeochemical cycles. Current nutrient management strategies aim to deliver soluble inorganic nutrients directly to crops and have uncoupled carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles in space and time. As a result, agricultural ecosystems are maintained in a state of nutrient saturation and are inherently leaky because chronic surplus additions of nitrogen and phosphorus are required to meet yield goals. Significant reductions of nutrient surpluses can only be achieved by managing a variety of intrinsic ecosystem processes at multiple scales to recouple elemental cycles. Rather than focusing solely on soluble, inorganic plant-available pools, an ecosystem-based approach would seek to optimize organic and mineral reservoirs with longer mean residence times that can be accessed through microbially and plant-mediated processes. Strategic use of varied nutrient sources, including inorganic fertilizers, combined with increases in plant diversity aimed at expanding the functional roles of plants in agroecosystems will help restore desired agroecosystem functions. To develop crops that can thrive in this environment, selection of cultivars and their associated microorganisms that are able to access a range of nutrient pools will be critical. Integrated management of biogeochemical processes that regulate the cycling of nutrients and carbon combined with increased reservoirs more readily retained in the soil will greatly reduce the need for surplus nutrient additions in agriculture. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

  title = {Biogeochemistry of Paddy Soils},
  volume = {157},
  issn = {00167061},
  abstract = {Paddy soils make up the largest anthropogenic wetlands on earth. They may originate from any type of soil in pedological terms, but are highly modified by anthropogenic activities. The formation of these Anthrosols is induced by tilling the wet soil (puddling), and the flooding and drainage regime associated with the development of a plough pan and specific redoximorphic features. Redox potential oscillations due to paddy management control microbial community structure and function and thus short-term biogeochemical processes. After flooding, microbial reduction processes sequentially use NO3 -, Mn4+, Fe3+, SO4 2- as electron acceptors, accompanied by the emission of the trace gases N2O, N2, H2S, CH4 and - due to reduction-induced increasing pH - NH3. This results in N losses and low N fertilizer use efficiency. However, transport of atmospheric O2 to the roots via the rice plant's aerenchyma modifies conditions in the rhizosphere, leading to nitrification and methane oxidation, and precipitation of Mn and Fe oxides. High concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in paddy soils from plant debris trigger microbial activity and thus the emission of greenhouse gases. Retention of DOM by soil minerals and its subsequent stabilisation against microbial decay depend on the redox state (e.g. DOM precipitation by Fe2+ under anaerobic conditions). Oscillation in redox conditions may enhance retention and stabilisation of DOM by Fe oxyhydroxides. Induced by the periodic short-term redox cycles, paddy management over long periods has strong effects on long-term biogeochemical processes. Frequent irrigation intensifies mineral weathering and leaching processes. High concentrations of DOM during flooding seasons enhance the changes and the release of structural iron in clay minerals, and support the formation of ferrihydrite. Repeated redox alternations lead to a translocation of iron in various directions, and particularly increase the crystallinity of iron oxides. This results also in higher total iron oxide contents in paddy compared to non-paddy soils. The large accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM) observed in some, but not all paddy soils, is considered to be due to high input of plant residues and charred material associated with retarded decomposition under anaerobic conditions. There is also evidence of SOM stabilisation via occlusion into aggregates and phytoliths as well as interactions with clay minerals and iron oxides. SOM accumulation in paddy subsoils can be explained by downward movement of DOM and its stabilisation by interaction with iron oxides. A specific feature of paddy soils is the coupling of organic matter turnover with mineral transformations and fluxes, which seem to be intensified by the alternating redox conditions with increasing age of paddy soil development. Bioavailability of soil organic N is strongly coupled to SOM cycling and is a crucial parameter determining crop yield. Anaerobic conditions inhibit N mineralization, with a high risk of gaseous N losses. In paddy soils the management-induced, microbially mediated redox processes control the dynamics of soil minerals and soil organic matter, which are strongly related to the microbial accessibility of C and N, but also of Fe. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

  title = {The Soil Carbon Dilemma: {{Shall}} We Hoard It or Use It?},
  volume = {38},
  abstract = {Rapidly rising concentrations of atmospheric CO 2 have prompted a flurry of studies on soils as potential carbon (C) 'sinks'. Sequestering C in soils is often seen as a 'win\textendash{}win' proposition; it not only removes excess CO 2 from the air, but also improves soils by augmenting organic matter, an energy and nutrient source for biota. But organic matter is most useful, biologically, when it decays. So we face a dilemma: can we both conserve organic matter and profit from its decay? Or must we choose one or the other? In this essay, I contemplate the merits, first of building soil C and then of decaying (losing) it, partly from a historical perspective. I then consider the apparent trade-off between accrual and decay, and reflect on how the dilemma might be resolved or assuaged. These fledgling thoughts, offered mostly to stir more fruitful debate, include: finding ways to increase C inputs to soil; seeking to optimize the timing of decay; and understanding better, from an ecosystem perspective, the flows of C, rather than only the stocks. Carbon sequestration is a sound and worthy goal. But soil organic matter is far more than a potential tank for impounding excess CO 2 ; it is a relentless flow of C atoms, through a myriad of streams\textemdash{}some fast, some slow\textemdash{}wending their way through the ecosystem, driving biotic processes along the way. Now, when we aim to regain some of the C lost, we may need new ways of thinking about soil C dynamics, and tuning them for the services expected of our ecosystems. This objective, perhaps demanding more biology along with other disciplines, is especially urgent when we contemplate the stresses soon to be imposed by coming global changes.},

Abstract.-The persistence of MUllerian mimicry and geographically distinct wing patterns, as observed in many Heliconius species (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae), is difficult to explain from a predator's perspective: predator selection against locally rare patterns must persist despite avoidance learning. Maintaining spatial color-pattern polymorphism requires local pattern avoidance, fine-scale discrimination among similar wing patterns, and repeated attacks on novel color patterns. I tested for these behaviors by presenting 80 adult rufous-tailed jacamars (Galbula ruficauda) with three morphs of Heliconius butterflies, and then presenting the same suite of butterflies to 46 of these jacamars between four and 429 days later. These trials offer the first direct evidence of the selective predator behavior required to maintain aposematic polymorphism: jacamars avoid local aposematic morphs while repeatedly attacking similar but novel morphs over time.},

Our results show that these model, frozen cultures produce N 2 O at tem-peratures as low as -32 \textbullet{} C.},

  abstract = {Row-crop agriculture is a major source of nitrous oxide (N2O) globally, and results from recent field experiments suggest that significant decreases in N2O emissions may be possible by decreasing nitrogen (N) fertilizer inputs without affecting economic return from grain yield. We tested this hypothesis on five commercially farmed fields in Michigan, USA planted with corn in 2007 and 2008. Six rates of N fertilizer (0\textendash{}225 kg N ha-1) were broadcast and incorporated before planting, as per local practice. Across all sites and years, increases in N2O flux were best described by a nonlinear, exponentially increasing response to increasing N rate. N2O emission factors per unit of N applied ranged from 0.6\% to 1.5\% and increased with increasing N application across all sites and years, especially at N rates above those required for maximum crop yield. At the two N fertilizer rates above those recommended for maximum economic return (135 kg N ha-1), average N2O fluxes were 43\% (18 g N2O\textendash{}N ha-1 day-1) and 115\% (26 g N2O\textendash{}N ha-1 day-1) higher than were fluxes at the recommended rate, respectively. The maximum return to nitrogen rate of 154 kg N ha-1 yielded an average 8.3 Mg grain ha-1. Our study shows the potential to lower agricultural N2O fluxes within a range of N fertilization that does not affect economic return from grain yield.},

Estimated at approximately 75 \texttimes{} 1015 gC/yr, this large natural flux is likely to increase due to changes in the Earth's condition. The objective of this paper is to provide a brief scientific review for policymakers who are concerned that changes in soil respiration may contribute to the rise in CO2 in Earth's atmosphere. Rising concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere will increase the flux of CO2 from soils, while simultaneously leaving a greater store of carbon in the soil. Traditional tillage cultivation and rising temperature increase the flux of CO2 from soils without increasing the stock of soil organic matter. Increasing deposi- tion of nitrogen from the atmosphere may lead to the sequestration of carbon in vegetation and soils. The response of the land biosphere to simultaneous changes in all of these factors is unknown, but a large increase in the soil carbon pool seems unlikely to moderate the rise in atmospheric CO2 during the next century.

The benefits of N added to cropping systems come, however, at well-documented environmental costs: Increased coastal hypoxia, atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O), reactive N gases in the troposphere, and N deposition onto forests and other natural areas are some of the consequences of our inability to keep fertilizer N from leaving cropped ecosystems via unmanaged pathways. The N cycle is complex, and solutions require a thorough understanding of both the biogeochemical pathways of N in agricultural systems and the consequences of different management practices. Despite the complexity of this challenge, however, a number of technologies are available today to reduce N loss. These include adding rotational complexity to cropping systems to improve N capture by crops, providing farmers with decision support tools for better predicting crop fertilizer N requirements, improving methods for optimizing fertilizer timing and placement, and developing watershed-level strategies to recapture N lost from fields. Solutions to the problem of agricultural N loss will require a portfolio approach in which different technologies are used in different combinations to address site-specific challenges. Solutions will also require incentives that promote their adoption.},

  abstract = {Mock communities have been used in microbiome method develop-ment to help estimate biases introduced in PCR amplification and sequencing and to optimize pipeline outputs. Nevertheless, the strong value of routine mock com-munity analysis beyond initial method development is rarely, if ever, considered. Here we report that our routine use of mock communities as internal standards al-lowed us to discover highly aberrant and strong biases in the relative proportions of multiple taxa in a single Illumina HiSeqPE250 run. In this run, an important archaeal taxon virtually disappeared from all samples, and other mock community taxa showed Ͼ2-fold high or low abundance, whereas a rerun of those identical ampli-cons (from the same reaction tubes) on a different date yielded " normal " results. Al-though obvious from the strange mock community results, we could have easily missed the problem had we not used the mock communities because of natural variation of microbiomes at our site. The " normal " results were validated over four MiSeqPE300 runs and three HiSeqPE250 runs, and run-to-run variation was usually low. While validating these " normal " results, we also discovered that some mock mi-crobial taxa had relatively modest, but consistent, differences between sequencing platforms. We strongly advise the use of mock communities in every sequencing run to distinguish potentially serious aberrations from natural variations. The mock com-munities should have more than just a few members and ideally at least partly rep-resent the samples being analyzed to detect problems that show up only in some taxa and also to help validate clustering. IMPORTANCE Despite the routine use of standards and blanks in virtually all chemi-cal or physical assays and most biological studies (a kind of " control "), microbiome analysis has traditionally lacked such standards. Here we show that unexpected problems of unknown origin can occur in such sequencing runs and yield com-pletely incorrect results that would not necessarily be detected without the use of standards. Assuming that the microbiome sequencing analysis works properly every time risks serious errors that can be detected by the use of mock communities.},

  abstract = {Soils in conventional agroecosystems are purposely held in a nitrogen (N)-saturated state to maximize crop yields. Planting winter annual cover crops when fields are usually fallow has been proposed to ameliorate N losses from soils. In this study we introduced winter annual cover crops into an N rate study with plots fertilized at 0, 34, 67, 101, 134, 168, and 202 kg N/ha in maize (Zea mays L.) to determine how winter annual cover crops affect yields, N2O and NO3- fluxes, and N pools. At the six-leaf stage and during flowering, incorporation of cover crop into soil resulted in a 30\% reduction in maize biomass. Three weeks after fertilization, KCl-extractable soil mineral N was 75-87\% lower in covercropped soils than in no-cover soils, indicating that N had been immobilized in the covercropped soils. At physiological maturity, there was no difference between cover and no-cover treatments in crop yield, which was maximized at 9 Mg/ha in 2006 and 7 Mg/ha in 2007. Where N rates exceed crop requirements, cover crop incorporation may reduce N exports as NO3- and N2O. Tighter N cycling in conventional agroecosystems could be fostered by matching N rates to the amount of N removed with grain and using N immobilization to retain N and support yields. If N immobilization is viewed as a means for efficient fertilizer N use rather than a process that decreases crop productivity, growers might be more willing to adopt cover-cropping practices.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) management is a key issue in livestock-free organic grain systems. Relay intercropping with a legume cover crop can be a useful technique for improving N availability when two cash crops are grown successively. We evaluated the benefits of four relay intercropped legumes (Medicago lupulina, Medicago sativa, Trifolium pratense and Trifolium repens) on N dynamics and their contribution to the associated and subsequent cash crops in six fields of organic farms located in South-East France. None of the relay intercropped legumes affected the N uptake of the associated winter wheat but all significantly increased the N uptake of the succeeding spring crop, either maize or spring wheat. The improvement of the N nutrition of the subsequent maize crop induced a 30 \% increase in grain yield. All relay intercropped legumes enriched the soil-plant system in N through symbiotic fixation. From 71 to 96 \% of the N contained in the shoots of the legumes in late autumn was derived from the atmosphere (Ndfa) and varied between 38 and 67 kg Ndfa ha-1. Even if the cover crop is expected to limit N leaching during wintertime, the presence of relay intercropped legumes had no significant effect on N leaching during winter compared to the control. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

To test how factors specific to host gut habitat shape microbial community structure, we performed reciprocal transplantations of these microbiotas into germ-free zebrafish and mouse recipients. The results reveal that communities are assembled in predictable ways. The transplanted community resembles its community of origin in terms of the lineages present, but the relative abundance of the lineages changes to resemble the normal gut microbial community composition of the recipient host. Thus, differences in community structure between zebrafish and mice arise in part from distinct selective pressures imposed within the gut habitat of each host. Nonetheless, vertebrate responses to microbial colonization of the gut are ancient: Functional genomic studies disclosed shared host responses to their compositionally distinct microbial communities and distinct microbial species that elicit conserved responses. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Although still unresolved, these problems are well studied in macro-ecology (the ecology of non-microbes) and are reiterated here as an historical precautionary for microbial ecologists. Beyond expected and unresolved terminological vagueness, we argue that assessments and comparisons of taxonomic and functional profiles in micro-ecology suffer from theoretically unresolvable arbitrariness and ambiguities. We divide these into problems of scale, individuation, and commensurability. We argue that there is no technically/theoretically ``correct'' scale, individuation, or comparison of taxonomy and function, but there are nonetheless better and worse methodologies for profiling.},

  volume = {121},
  issn = {1573515X},
  abstract = {Peatlands store vast amounts of soil carbon and are significant sources of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2) andmethane (CH4) emissions. The traditional approach in biogeochemical model simulations of peatland emissions is to simply divide the soil domain into an aerobic zone above and an anaerobic zone below the water table (WT) and then calculate CO2 and CH4 emissions based on the assumed properties of these two discrete zones. However, there are major potential drawbacks associated with the traditional WT-based approach, because aerobic or anaerobic environments are ultimately determined by oxygen (O-2) concentration rather than water content directly. Variations in O2 content above and below the WT can be large and thus may play an important role in partitioning of carbon fluxes between CO2 and CH4. In this paper, we propose an oxygen-based approach, which simulates the vertical and radial components of O-2 movement and consumption through the soil aerobic and anaerobic environments. We then use both our oxygen-based and the traditional WT-based approaches to simulate CO2 and CH4 emissions from an Alaskan fen peatland. The results of model calibration and validation suggest that our physically realistic approach (i.e., oxygen-based approach) cause less biases on the simulated flux of CO2 and CH4. The results of model simulations also suggest that the traditional WT-based approach might substantially under-estimate CH4 emissions and over-estimate CO2 emissions from the fen due to the presence of anaerobic zones in unsaturated soil. Our oxygen-based approach can be easily incorporated into existing ecosystem or earth system models but will require additional validation with more extensive field observations to be implemented within biogeochemical models to improve simulations of soil C fluxes at regional or global scale.},

  issn = {0308521X},
  abstract = {Cropping systems that provide ecosystem services beyond crop production are gaining interest from farmers, policy makers and society at large, yet we lack frameworks to evaluate and manage for multiple ecosystem services. Using the example of integrating cover crops into annual crop rotations, we present an assessment framework that: (1) estimates the temporal dynamics of a suite of ecosystem services; (2) illustrates ecosystem multifunctionality using spider plots; and (3) identifies key time points for optimizing ecosystem service benefits and minimizing trade-offs. Using quantitative models and semi-quantitative estimates, we applied the framework to analyze the temporal dynamics of 11 ecosystem services and two economic metrics when cover crops are introduced into a 3-year soybean (Glycine max)-wheat (Triticum aestivum)-corn (Zea mays) rotation in a typical Mid-Atlantic climate. We estimated that cover crops could increase 8 of 11 ecosystem services without negatively influencing crop yields. We demonstrate that when we measure ecosystem services matters and cumulative assessments can be misleading due to the episodic nature of some services and the time sensitivity of management windows. For example, nutrient retention benefits occurred primarily during cover crop growth, weed suppression benefits occurred during cash crop growth through a cover crop legacy effect, and soil carbon benefits accrued slowly over decades. Uncertainties exist in estimating cover crop effects on several services, such as pest dynamics. Trade-offs occurred between cover crop ecosystem benefits, production costs, and management risks. Differences in production costs with and without cover crops varied 3-fold over 10. years, largely due to changes in fertilizer prices, and thus cover crop use will become more economical with increasing fertilizer prices or if modest cost-sharing programs are established. Frameworks such as that presented here provide the means to quantify ecosystem services and facilitate the transition to more multifunctional agricultural systems. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  volume = {112},
  issn = {21699011},
  abstract = {On hillslopes the balance between soil transport and production determines local soil thickness and the age distribution of particles that comprise the soil (where age refers to the time elapsed since detachment from bedrock). The mean of this age distribution is defined as the residence time, and in a landscape with time-invariant topography (i.e., morphologic steady state), the spatial uniformity of soil production ensures that the residence time of soils is spatially invariant. Thus, given constant soil-forming factors, spatial variation of soil properties reflects differences in residence time driven by nonuniform soil production. Spatially extensive soil databases, which are often freely available in electronic form, provide a cheap and accessible means of analyzing patterns of soil residence time and quantifying landscape dynamics. Here we use a soil chronosequence to calibrate a chronofunction describing the reddening of soils in the Oregon Coast Range, which is then used to quantify the spatial distribution of soil residence time. In contrast to the popular conception that the Oregon Coast Range experiences uniform erosion, we observe systematic variations in soil residence time driven by stream capture, deep-seated landsliding, and lateral channel migration. Large, contiguous areas with short residence time soils (hue 10YR) occur west of the Siuslaw River\textendash{}Long Tom Creek drainage divide, whereas soil patches with redder hues of 7.5YR or 5YR indicate longer residence times and transient landscape conditions. These zones of red soils (5YR) occur east of the Siuslaw\textendash{}Long Tom divide, coinciding with low-gradient ridge and valley topography and deeply alluviated valleys resulting from drainage reversal in the Quaternary. Patches of red soils are also associated with deep-seated landslides at various locations in our study area. Our calculated soil residence times appear subject to overestimation resulting from limitations of the simple weathering index used here and chronofunction calibration uncertainties. Nonetheless, our soil residence time estimates appear accurate to within an order of magnitude and provide a useful constraint on landscape dynamics over geomorphic timescales.},

  title = {The Complex Relationship between Microbial Growth Rate and Yield and Its Implications for Ecosystem Processes},
  volume = {6},
  issn = {1664302X},
  abstract = {Growth rate and efficiency are fundamental traits of microbes that significantly influence how communities and ecosystems function. However the microbiological literature shows an apparent contradiction in the relationship between growth rate and yield (defined as the portion of consumed substrate that is converted into biomass or ATP). Pirt (1965) defined maintenance energy in growing bacterial cultures and predicted that slow growth rates would be associated with inefficient growth. This idea is consistent with studies of bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) in marine and aquatic ecosystems. However, a separate body of literature supports a negative relationship between growth rate and yield, and finds that this rate-yield tradeoff is central in evolution and the coexistence of species. The concept of yield arises in the terrestrial biogeochemical literature, but under the term, carbon use efficiency (CUE), where researchers are concerned with the rates of carbon dioxide (CO2) lost from the ecosystem through microbial respiration, and how the partitioning of plant litter into soil carbon (C) and CO2 is affected by climate change. Here the rate-yield tradeoff also has important implications. I believe the seemingly contradictory points of view expressed in the literature can be reconciled by considering the growth conditions, ecological strategies and level of organization treated by these various studies. This opinion article is not intended as a comprehensive review. Excellent reviews and analyses of various aspects of this literature exist (Russell and Cook, 1995; Del Giorgio and Cole, 1998; Ferenci, 1999; Carlson et al., 2007; Van Bodegom, 2007; Wang and Post, 2012; Sinsabaugh et al., 2013). These works have resolved much of the perceived ambiguity in the field, but to my knowledge no one has directly addressed the apparent paradox mentioned above. Maintenance},

  issn = {0144-8765},
  abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the N-fixation potential of different leguminous green manure plants grown in the autumn after harvest of a barley main crop. Fixed above ground N derived from the atmosphere (N-dfa) was estimated both by the N-15 isotope dilution method and by the total-N difference method. Winter rape (Brassica napus), winter rye (Secale cereale) and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) were grown as non-fixing control plants for the estimation of N-fixation of leguminous green manure plants. It was concluded that Italian ryegrass was the most suitable control plant, and that the choice of control plant can be important for the results. When using Italian ryegrass as control plant, no significant difference was observed between the total N difference method and the N-15 isotope dilution method. N-fixation varied strongly among the plant species and differed between the two years. Hairy vetch (Vieia villosa), crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum) and Persian clover (Trifolium respinatum) fixed more than 100 kg N ha(-1) at least in one of the two investigated years. The highest estimated N was 149 kg N ha(-1) in the above ground plant material of hairy vetch in 1997. N-dfa of common vetch (Vicia sativa) and Egyptian clover (Trifolium alexandrinum) was below 60 or 100 kg N ha(-1) in 1996 and 1997, respectively. Weather conditions and soil moisture, which are crucial during germination and early plant development, may be an explanation for lower N-fixation in 1996 than in 1997. With respect to N, the results indicate that extended use of green manure could strongly reduce the need for full year green manure crops in stockless organic crop rotations.},

  title = {The Contribution of Manure and Fertilizer Nitrogen to Atmospheric Nitrous Oxide since 1860},
  volume = {2},
  issn = {1752-0894},
  abstract = {Atmospheric nitrous oxide concentrations have been increasing since the industrial revolution and currently account for 6\% of total anthropogenic radiative forcing. Microbial production in soils is the dominant nitrous oxide source; this has increased with increasing use of nitrogen fertilizers. However, fertilizer use alone cannot account for the historical trends of atmospheric concentrations of nitrous oxide. Here, I analyse atmospheric concentrations, industrial sources of nitrous oxide, and fertilizer and manure production since 1860. Before 1960, agricultural expansion, including livestock production, may have caused globally significant mining of soil nitrogen, fuelling a steady increase in atmospheric nitrous oxide. After 1960, the rate of the increase rose, due to accelerating use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Using a regression model, I show that 2.0\% of manure nitrogen and 2.5\% of fertilizer nitrogen was converted to nitrous oxide between 1860 and 2005; these percentage contributions explain the entire pattern of increasing nitrous oxide concentrations over this period. Consideration of processes that re-concentrate soil nitrogen, such as manure production by livestock, improved 'hind-casting' of nitrous oxide emissions. As animal protein consumption in human diets increases globally, management of manure will be an important component of future efforts to reduce anthropogenic nitrous oxide sources.},

  volume = {85},
  issn = {01682563},
  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a structure for organo-mineral associations in soils based on recent insights concerning the molecular struc- ture of soil organic matter (SOM), and on exten- sive published evidence from empirical studies of organo-mineral interfaces. Our conceptual model assumes that SOM consists of a heteroge- neous mixture of compounds that display a range of amphiphilic or surfactant-like properties, and are capable of self-organization in aqueous solu- tion. An extension of this self-organizational behavior in solution, we suggest that SOM sorbs to mineral surfaces in a discrete zonal sequence. In the contact zone, the formation of particularly strong organo-mineral associations appears to be favored by situations where either (i) polar organic functional groups of amphiphiles interact via ligand exchange with singly coordinated mineral hydroxyls, forming stable inner-sphere com- plexes, or (ii) proteinaceous materials unfold upon adsorption, thus increasing adhesive strength by adding hydrophobic interactions to electrostatic binding. Entropic considerations dictate that exposed hydrophobic portions of amphiphilic molecules adsorbed directly to min- eral surfaces be shielded from the polar aqueous phase through association with hydrophobic moi- eties of other amphiphilic molecules. This pro- cess can create a membrane-like bilayer containing a hydrophobic zone, whose compo- nents may exchange more easily with the sur- rounding soil solution than those in the contact zone, but which are still retained with consider- able force. Sorbed to the hydrophilic exterior of hemimicellar coatings, or to adsorbed proteins, are organic molecules forming an outer region, or kinetic zone, that is loosely retained by cation bridging, hydrogen bonding, and other interac- tions. Organic material in the kinetic zone may experience high exchange rates with the sur- rounding soil solution, leading to short residence times for individual molecular fragments. The thickness of this outer region would depend more on input than on the availability of binding sites, and would largely be controlled by exchange kinetics. Movement of organics into and out of this outer region can thus be viewed as similar to a phase-partitioning process. The zonal concept of organo-mineral interactions presented here oVers a new basis for understanding and predicting the retention of organic compounds, including contaminants, in soils and sediments.},

  abstract = {Because of public and political concern for the quality of surface and ground water, leaching of nitrate is el special concern in many countries. To evaluate the effects of tillage and growth of a catch crop on nitrate leaching, two field trials were conducted in spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) under temperate coastal climate conditions. On a coarse sand (1987-1992), ploughing in autumn or in spring in combination with perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) as a catch crop was evaluated. Furthermore, rotovating and direct drilling were included. The experiment was conducted on a 19-year-old field trial with continuous production of spring barley. On a sandy foam (1988-1992), ploughing in autumn or in spring in combination with stubble cultivation and perennial ryegrass, in addition to minimum tillage, was evaluated in a newly established field trial. For calculation of nitrate leaching, soil water isolates from depths of 0.8 or 1.0 m were taken using ceramic cups. No significant effect of tillage was found on the course sand; however, a significant effect of tillage was found on the sandy loam, where leaching from autumn ploughed plots without stubble cultivation was 16 kg N ha-1 year-1 higher than leaching from spring ploughed plots. Leaching was significantly less when stubble cultivation in autumn was omitted. Leaching on both soil types was significantly reduced by the growth of a catch crop which was ploughed under in autumn or in spring. It was concluded that soil cultivation increased leaching on the sandy loam but not on the coarse sand, and that the growth of perennial ryegrass as a catch crop reduced leaching on both soil types, particularly when ryegrass was ploughed under in spring.},

  abstract = {The large pool of actively cycling carbon (C) held in soils is susceptible to release due to changes in landuse, management, or climate. Yet, the amount and distribution of potentially mineralizable C present in soils of various types and the method by which this soil C fraction can best be quantified, are not well established. The distribution of total organic C (TOC), extractable C pools (hot-water-extractable and acid-hydrolyzable), and in vitro mineralizable C in 138 surface soils across a north Florida watershed was found to be quite heterogeneous. Thus, these C quality parameters could not statistically distinguish the eight landuses or four major soil orders represented. Only wetland and upland forest soils, with the largest and smallest C pool size, respectively, were consistently different from the soils of other landuse types. Variations in potential C mineralization were best explained by TOC (62\%) and hot-water-extractable C (59\%), whereas acid-hydrolyzable C (32\%) and clay content (35\%) were generally not adequate indicators of C bioavailability. Within certain landuse and soil orders (Alfisol, Wetland and Rangeland, all with 3\% clay content), however, C mineralization and clay content were directly linearly correlated, indicating a possible stimulatory effect of clay on microbial processing of C. Generally, the sandy nature of these surface soils imparted a lack of protection against C mineralization and likely resulted in the lack of landuse/soil order differences in the soil C pools. If a single parameter is to be chosen to quantify the potential for soil C mineralization in southeastern U.S. coastal plain soils, we recommend TOC as the most efficient soil variable to measure. \textcopyright{} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The synergetic effects of recent rising atmospheric CO(2) and temperature are expected to favor tree growth in boreal and temperate forests. However, recent dendrochronological studies have shown site-specific unprecedented growth enhancements or declines. The question of whether either of these trends is caused by changes in the atmosphere remains unanswered because dendrochronology alone has not been able to clarify the physiological basis of such trends.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we combined standard dendrochronological methods with carbon isotopic analysis to investigate whether atmospheric changes enhanced water use efficiency (WUE) and growth of two deciduous and two coniferous tree species along a 9 degrees latitudinal gradient across temperate and boreal forests in Ontario, Canada. Our results show that although trees have had around 53\% increases in WUE over the past century, growth decline (measured as a decrease in basal area increment--BAI) has been the prevalent response in recent decades irrespective of species identity and latitude. Since the 1950s, tree BAI was predominantly negatively correlated with warmer climates and/or positively correlated with precipitation, suggesting warming induced water stress. However, where growth declines were not explained by climate, WUE and BAI were linearly and positively correlated, showing that declines are not always attributable to warming induced stress and additional stressors may exist.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS: Our results show an unexpected widespread tree growth decline in temperate and boreal forests due to warming induced stress but are also suggestive of additional stressors. Rising atmospheric CO2 levels during the past century resulted in consistent increases in water use efficiency, but this did not prevent growth decline. These findings challenge current predictions of increasing terrestrial carbon stocks under climate change scenarios.},

  issn = {02660032},
  abstract = {In Northern Europe, cover crops are traditionally established before spring crops by undersowing, but some cover crops might also have an effect if preharvest sown before spring crops and even winter crops. The effects of cover crop sowing date, sowing technique and succeeding main crop on biomass production, N uptake, nitrate leaching and soil inorganic N were tested in lysimeters and in the field. Cruciferous cover crops (oil radish, white mustard) were sown preharvest by broadcasting into winter wheat in July and were allowed to grow until a following winter wheat was established in September. Other preharvest cover crops were left in place until late autumn. For comparison, the same cruciferous cover crops were established postharvest after light harrowing. Perennial ryegrass undersown in spring barley was also included. Aboveground N uptake in preharvest cover crops amounted to a maximum of 24 kg N/ha in September before sowing winter wheat. When left until late autumn, preharvest oil radish took up a maximum of 66 kg N/ha, and ryegrass and postharvest cover crops 35 kg N/ha. Preharvest establishment of cruciferous cover crops before a spring-sown crop thus seems promising. The soil was depleted of inorganic N to the same extent in late autumn irrespective of cover crop type, sowing time and technique within winter wheat or spring barley. However, the reduction in nitrate leaching of preharvest cover crops incorporated after 2 months and followed by winter wheat was only half of that achieved by cover crops left until late autumn or spring.},

By hypothesis, three fundamental organelles: the mitochondria, the photosynthetic plastids and the (9+2) basal bodies of flagella were themselves once free-living (prokaryotic) cells. The evolution of photosynthesis under the anaerobic conditions of the early atmosphere to form anaerobic bacteria, photosynthetic bacteria and eventually blue-green algae (and protoplastids) is described. The subsequent evolution of aerobic metabolism in prokaryotes to form aerobic bacteria (protoflagella and protomitochondria) presumably occurred during the transition to the oxidizing atmosphere. Classical mitosis evolved in protozoan-type cells millions of years after the evolution of photosynthesis. A plausible scheme for the origin of classical mitosis in primitive amoeboflagellates is presented. During the course of the evolution of mitosis, photosynthetic plastids (themselves derived from prokaryotes) were symbiotically acquired by some of these protozoans to form the eukaryotic algae and the green plants. The cytological, biochemical and paleontological evidence for this theory is presented, along with suggestions for further possible experimental verification. The implications of this scheme for the systematics of the lower organisms is discussed.},

  volume = {220},

  abstract = {The effectiveness of growing winter cover crops to mitigate nitrogen (N) leaching can be widely variable, even within a single climatic zone. We sought to investigate key drivers of this variability for the Canterbury Plains of New Zealand. First, through an analysis of local field experiments, we quantified the local variability in the effectiveness of cover crops to reduce N leaching. We then calibrated and applied a biophysical model to isolate the impact of potential drivers of this variability. Crop management (cover crop sowing date), soil water holding capacity (WHC) and inter-annual weather variability (30 years of historical climate) were selected as main factors to be investigated. The analysis of local literature showed that, compared to fallow treatments, winter cover crops reduced N leaching by an average ({$\pm$}95\% CI) of 17{$\pm$}8.2kgNha-1. This represented a median N leaching reduction of {$\sim$}50\% with a wide interquartile range (6\textendash{}75\%). The modelling study showed that the delay in sowing dates consistently reduced the average effectiveness of cover crops, from 80\% for March- to 25\% for June-sown crops. For any ``sowing date by soil WHC'' scenario, there was also a large year to year variability. This was caused by the stochastic effect of inter-annual weather variability on the dynamics of crop N demand and soil N supply. For the conditions assumed in the modelling study, a sensitivity analysis of simulated results showed that sowing dates were the main contributor to total variability in the effectiveness of cover crops, followed by weather, factor interactions and soil WHC. These results suggest the need for caution when interpreting data from individual field trials due to the impact of inter-annual variability and interactions among multiple drivers on cover crop effectiveness. In addition, our analysis highlights the value of complementary methodologies, such as biophysical modelling, for extending the inference space of individual field studies.},

  abstract = {The taxonomy of Paracoccus denitrificans and related bacteria is discussed. Evidence is given which shows that the physiological differences between P. denitrificans and Thiosphaera pantotropha are less fundamental than previously thought. A proposal to consider a species P. pantotropha is mentioned. The properties of the denitrifying enzymes and the genes involved in their formation in P. denitrificans is discussed. The synthesis of the membrane-bound-nitrate reductase is regulated by FNR, that of the nitrite- and nitric oxide reductase by NNR. Evidence is given that FNR acts as a redox sensor rather than an oxygen sensor. The occurrence of aerobic denitrification and coupled heterotrophic nitrification-denitrification in the original strain of Thiosphaera pantotropha are explained by a limiting respiratory activity which activates FNR. Aerobic denitrification leads to a lower growth yield and an increase in mumax in batch culture when a limiting respiratory activity is assumed and when excess substrate is present. Coupled heterotrophic nitrification-denitrification gives a smaller increase in mumax and a more drastic reduction in yield. Both processes are thus advantageous to the organism. In a chemostat with limiting substrate these processes are disadvantageous. T. pantotropha has lost the ability for aerobic denitrification during extended cultivation. Possibly the substrate concentration was limiting during extended cultivation giving a selective advantage to variants which have lost these properties. The calculations predict that P. denitrificans should be able to grow chemolithotrophically with hydroxylamine.},

  issn = {01678809},
  abstract = {Fertilizer nitrogen (N) use is expanding globally to satisfy food, fiber, and fuel demands of a growing world population. Fertilizer consumers are being asked to improve N use efficiency through better management in their fields, to protect water resources and to minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while sustaining soil resources and providing a healthy economy. A review of the available science on the effects of N source, rate, timing, and placement, in combination with other cropping and tillage practices, on GHG emissions was conducted. Implementation of intensive crop management practices, using principles of ecological intensification to enhance efficient and effective nutrient uptake while achieving high yields, was identified as a principal way to achieve reductions in GHG emissions while meeting production demands. Many studies identified through the review involved measurements of GHG emissions over several weeks to a few months, which greatly limit the ability to accurately determine system-level management effects on net global warming potential. The current science indicates: (1) appropriate fertilizer N use helps increase biomass production necessary to help restore and maintain soil organic carbon (SOC) levels; (2) best management practices (BMPs) for fertilizer N play a large role in minimizing residual soil nitrate, which helps lower the risk of increased nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions; (3) tillage practices that reduce soil disturbance and maintain crop residue on the soil surface can increase SOC levels, but usually only if crop productivity is maintained or increased; (4) differences among fertilizer N sources in N2O emissions depend on site- and weather-specific conditions; and (5) intensive crop management systems do not necessarily increase GHG emissions per unit of crop or food production; they can help spare natural areas from conversion to cropland and allow conversion of selected lands to forests for GHG mitigation, while supplying the world's need for food, fiber, and biofuel. Transfer of the information to fertilizer dealers, crop advisers, farmers, and agricultural and environmental authorities should lead to increased implementation of fertilizer BMPs, and help to reduce confusion over the role of fertilizer N on cropping system emissions of GHGs. Gaps in scientific understanding were identified and will require the collaborative attention of agronomists, soil scientists, ecologists, and environmental authorities in serving the immediate and long-term interests of the human population. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we showed that organic amendments in three long-term (23, 154, and 170 yrs, respectively) field experiments significantly increased mineral availability, particularly of short-range-ordered (SRO) phases. Two microcosm studies demonstrated that the presence of roots significantly increased mineral availability and promoted the formation of SRO phases. Mineral transformation experiments and isotopic labeling experiments provided direct evidence that citric acid, a major component of root exudates, promoted the formation of SRO minerals, and that SRO minerals acted as ``nuclei'' for C retention. Together, these findings indicate that soil organic amendments initialize a positive feedback loop by increasing mineral availability and promoting the formation of SRO minerals for further C binding, thereby possibly serving as a management tool for enhancing carbon storage in soils.},

  abstract = {Nitrate (NO ) leaching from agricultural production systems is blamed for the rising concentrations of NO in 3 3 2 ground- and surface-waters around the world. This paper reviews the evidence of NO leaching losses from 3 various land use systems, including cut grassland, grazed pastures, arable cropping, mixed cropping with pasture leys, organic farming, horticultural systems, and forest ecosystems. Soil, climatic and management factors which 2 2 affect NO leaching are discussed. Nitrate leaching occurs when there is an accumulation of NO in the soil 3 3 profile that coincides with or is followed by a period of high drainage. Therefore, excessive nitrogen (N) fertilizer or waste effluent application rates or N applications at the wrong time (e.g. late autumn) of the year, ploughing 2 pasture leys early in the autumn, or long periods of fallow ground, can all potentially lead to high NO leaching 3 2 losses. N returns in animal urine have a major impact on NO leaching in grazed pastures. Of the land use systems 3 2 considered in this paper, the potential for causing NO leaching typically follow the order: forest , cut grassland 3 , grazed pastures, arable cropping , ploughing of pasture , market gardens. A range of management options to 2 mitigate NO leaching is described, including reducing N application rates, synchronizing N supply to plant 3 demand, use of cover crops, better timing of ploughing pasture leys, improved stock management, precision farming, and regulatory measures. This is followed by a discussion of future research needs to improve our ability 2 to predict and mitigate NO leaching.},

  abstract = {Denitrification is a distinct means of energy conservation, making use of N oxides as terminal electron acceptors for cellular bioenergetics under anaerobic, microaerophilic, and occasionally aerobic conditions. The process is an essential branch of the global N cycle, reversing dinitrogen fixation, and is associated with chemolithotrophic, phototrophic, diazotrophic, or organotrophic metabolism but generally not with obligately anaerobic life. Discovered more than a century ago and believed to be exclusively a bacterial trait, denitrification has now been found in halophilic and hyperthermophilic archaea and in the mitochondria of fungi, raising evolutionarily intriguing vistas. Important advances in the biochemical characterization of denitrification and the underlying genetics have been achieved with Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Paracoccus denitrificans, Ralstonia eutropha, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Pseudomonads represent one of the largest assemblies of the denitrifying bacteria within a single genus, favoring their use as model organisms. Around 50 genes are required within a single bacterium to encode the core structures of the denitrification apparatus. Much of the denitrification process of gram-negative bacteria has been found confined to the periplasm, whereas the topology and enzymology of the gram-positive bacteria are less well established. The activation and enzymatic transformation of N oxides is based on the redox chemistry of Fe, Cu, and Mo. Biochemical breakthroughs have included the X-ray structures of the two types of respiratory nitrite reductases and the isolation of the novel enzymes nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase, as well as their structural characterization by indirect spectroscopic means. This revealed unexpected relationships among denitrification enzymes and respiratory oxygen reductases. Denitrification is intimately related to fundamental cellular processes that include primary and secondary transport, protein translocation, cytochrome c biogenesis, anaerobic gene regulation, metalloprotein assembly, and the biosynthesis of the cofactors molybdopterin and heme D1. An important class of regulators for the anaerobic expression of the denitrification apparatus are transcription factors of the greater FNR family. Nitrate and nitric oxide, in addition to being respiratory substrates, have been identified as signaling molecules for the induction of distinct N oxide-metabolizing enzymes.},

Hybrids are usually rare and unfit, but even infrequent hybridization can aid adaptation by transferring beneficial traits between species. Here we use genomic tools to investigate introgression in Heliconius, a rapidly radiating genus of neotropical butterflies widely used in studies of ecology, behaviour, mimicry and speciation(2-5). We sequenced the genome of Heliconius melpomene and compared it with other taxa to investigate chromosomal evolution in Lepidoptera and gene flow among multiple Heliconius species and races. Among 12,669 predicted genes, biologically important expansions of families of chemosensory and Hox genes are particularly noteworthy. Chromosomal organization has remained broadly conserved since the Cretaceous period, when butterflies split from the Bombyx (silkmoth) lineage. Using genomic resequencing, we show hybrid exchange of genes between three co-mimics, Heliconius melpomene, Heliconius timareta and Heliconius elevatus, especially at two genomic regions that control mimicry pattern. We infer that closely related Heliconius species exchange protective colour-pattern genes promiscuously, implying that hybridization has an important role in adaptive radiation.},

  abstract = {Current land surface models assume that groundwater, streamflow and plant transpiration are all sourced and mediated by the same well mixed water reservoir\textemdash{}the soil. However, recent work in Oregon1 and Mexico2 has shown evidence of ecohydrological separation, whereby different subsurface compartmentalized pools of water supply either plant transpiration fluxes or the combined fluxes of groundwater and streamflow. These findings have not yet been widely tested. Here we use hydrogen and oxygen isotopic data (2H/1H ({$\delta$}2H) and 18O/16O ({$\delta$}18O)) from 47 globally distributed sites to show that ecohydrological separation is widespread across different biomes. Precipitation, stream water and groundwater from each site plot approximately along the {$\delta$}2H/{$\delta$}18O slope of local precipitation inputs. But soil and plant xylem waters extracted from the 47 sites all plot below the local stream water and groundwater on the meteoric water line, suggesting that plants use soil water that does not itself contribute to groundwater recharge or streamflow. Our results further show that, at 80\% of the sites, the precipitation that supplies groundwater recharge and streamflow is different from the water that supplies parts of soil water recharge and plant transpiration. The ubiquity of subsurface water compartmentalization found here, and the segregation of storm types relative to hydrological and ecological fluxes, may be used to improve numerical simulations of runoff generation, stream water transit time and evaporation\textendash{}transpiration partitioning. Future land surface model parameterizations should be closely examined for how vegetation, groundwater recharge and streamflow are assumed to be coupled.},

  abstract = {The internal transformations of nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems exert strong controls over nitrogen availability to net primary productivity, nitrate leaching into groundwater, and emissions of nitrogen-based greenhouse gas. Here we report a reductive pathway for nitrogen cycling in upland tropical forest soils that decreases the amount of nitrate susceptible to leaching and denitrification, thus conserving nitrogen in the ecosystem. Using 15N tracers we measured rates of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) in upland humid tropical forest soils averaging {$\sim$}0.6 {$\mu$}g\textperiodcentered{}g-1 \textperiodcentered{}d-1. Rates of DNRA were three times greater than the combined N2O and N2 fluxes from nitrification and denitrification and accounted for 75\% of the turnover of the nitrate pool. To determine the relative importance of ambient C, O2, and NO3 concentrations on rates of DNRA, we estimated rates of DNRA in laboratory assays using soils from three tropical forests (cloud forest, palm forest, and wet tropical forest) that differed in ambient C and O2 concentrations. Rates of DNRA measured in laboratory assays ranged from 0.5 to 9 {$\mu$}g\textperiodcentered{}g-1 \textperiodcentered{}d-1 in soils from the three different forests and appeared to be primarily limited by the availability of NO3, as opposed to C or O2. Tests of sterile soils indicated that the dominant reductive pathway for both NO2 and NO3 was biotic and not abiotic. Because NH4 is the form of N generally favored for assimilation by plants and microbes, and NO3 is easily lost from the ecosystem, the rapid and direct transformation of NO3 to NH4 via DNRA has the potential to play an important role in ecosystem N conservation.},

  volume = {18},
  issn = {00380717},
  abstract = {Principles of isotope dilution, modeling, and nonlinear parameter estimation were used to simultaneously determine N cycle rates. Analysis of the sensitivity coefficients for the models used in this study demonstrated that the four parameters of interest-the rates or rate constants of mineralization, immobilization, nitrification, and denitrification-were estimable. This analysis also illustrated which sampling design would be best for the experiments performed. We found that both zero- and first-order models could describe N cycling, with the first-order model being more generally appropriate. The estimates obtained for mineralization, immobilization, and nitrification had relatively small standard errors; however, denitrification parameters were poorly estimated. This is due in part to the much lower rate of denitrification (\~1000 times smaller) when compared to the rates of the other processes and also to the insensitivity of the measured responses to changes in the denitrification parameter. The rates or rate constants for the four processes compared favorably with those reported by others. Highest nitrification rates were found in agricultural soils [1-5 and 1-34 mg N kg-1 day-1) compared with a forest soil ( 1 mg N kg-1 day-1). Rates of mineralization (0.6-1.5 mg N kg-1 day-1) and immobilization (0.1-4 mg N kg-1day-1) were similar in all soils, although immobilization was favored in the agricultural sandy loam. Denitrification was considerably higher in the agricultural clay loam ( 500 ??g N kg-1day-1) than in the coarser textured soils (\~10 ??g N kg-1day-1). Some experimental data could not be fit with zero- or first-order kinetics, however this was most likely because the model did not account for all of the processes occurring in these soils, rather than limitations to the parameter estimation procedure itself. Even with the relatively high degree of experimental variability inherent in measuring N pool sizes and 15N ratios, reasonably good parameter estimates were obtained in these laboratory incubations, demonstrating the feasibility of simultaneously estimating the rates of several N cycle processes. The trends in N cycle rates among the soils investigated were consistent with those normally associated with forest and agricultural soils, further corroborating the utility of this method. ?? 1986.},

  abstract = {Trait-based studies can help clarify the mechanisms driving patterns of microbial community assembly and coexistence. Here, we use a trait-based approach to explore the importance of rRNA operon copy number in microbial succession, building on prior evidence that organisms with higher copy numbers respond more rapidly to nutrient inputs. We set flasks of heterotrophic media into the environment and examined bacterial community assembly at seven time points. Communities were arrayed along a geographic gradient to introduce stochasticity via dispersal processes and were analyzed using 16 S rRNA gene pyrosequencing, and rRNA operon copy number was modeled using ancestral trait reconstruction. We found that taxonomic composition was similar between communities at the beginning of the experiment and then diverged through time; as well, phylogenetic clustering within communities decreased over time. The average rRNA operon copy number decreased over the experiment, and variance in rRNA operon copy number was lowest both early and late in succession. We then analyzed bacterial community data from other soil and sediment primary and secondary successional sequences from three markedly different ecosystem types. Our results demonstrate that decreases in average copy number are a consistent feature of communities across various drivers of ecological succession. Importantly, our work supports the scaling of the copy number trait over multiple levels of biological organization, ranging from cells to populations and communities, with implications for both microbial ecology and evolution.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 13 November 2015; doi:10.1038/ismej.2015.191.},

We studied the response of Nitrosospira sp. strain AF-like ammonia oxidizers to changing environmental conditions by applying molecular methods and physiological measurements to Californian grassland soil manipulated in the laboratory. This soil is naturally high in Nitrosospira sp. strain AF-like bacteria relative to the much-better-studied Nitrosospira multiformis-like ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Increases in temperature, soil moisture, and fertilizer interacted to reduce the relative abundance of Nitrosospira sp. strain AF-like bacteria, although they remained numerically dominant. The overall abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria increased with increasing soil moisture and decreased with increasing temperature. Potential nitrification activity was altered by interactions among temperature, soil moisture, and fertilizer, with activity tending to be higher when soil moisture and temperature were increased. The increase in potential nitrification activity with increased temperature was surprising, given that the overall abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria decreased significantly under these conditions. This observation suggests that (i) Nitrosospira sp. strain AF-like bacteria may respond to increased temperature with an increase in activity, despite a decrease in abundance, or (ii) that potential nitrification activity in these soils may be due to organisms other than bacteria (e.g., archaeal ammonia oxidizers), at least under conditions of increased temperature.},

Interactions among these three environmental factors influenced the N2O emission rates, and two patterns of N2O emission rates due to nitrification (NitN(2)O) were observed. First, in soils receiving low or moderate amounts of fertilizer, the rates decreased sharply in response to increasing soil moisture and temperature. Second, in soils receiving high amounts of fertilizer, the rates were influenced by an interaction between soil moisture and temperature, such that at 20 degrees C increasing soil moisture resulted in an increase in the rates, and at 30 degrees C the highest rate was observed at moderate soil moisture. We used path analysis to identify the interrelationships that best explain these two patterns. Path analysis revealed that in the high fertilizer (HF) treatment, the major path by which ammonia influenced NitN(2)O rates was indirect through an influence on the abundance of one particular phylogenetic group (AOB 'cluster 10'). In contrast, in the low and moderate fertilizer treatments soil moisture influenced the rates both directly (the major path) and indirectly through AOB community structure. Although terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis revealed shifts in the community structure of AOB in all treatments, the shifts at HF concentrations were particularly striking, with dominance by three different phylogenetic groups under different combinations of the three environmental factors. The high emission rates observed at the lowest soil moistures suggest that bacterial nitrifiers may use denitrification as a stress response.},

  abstract = {Therapeutic food interventions have reduced mortality in children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM), but incomplete restoration of healthy growth remains a major problem. The relationships between the type of nutritional intervention, the gut microbiota, and therapeutic responses are unclear. In the current study, bacterial species whose proportional representation define a healthy gut microbiota as it assembles during the first two postnatal years were identified by applying a machine-learning-based approach to 16S ribosomal RNA data sets generated from monthly faecal samples obtained from birth onwards in a cohort of children living in an urban slum of Dhaka, Bangladesh, who exhibited consistently healthy growth. These age-discriminatory bacterial species were incorporated into a model that computes a 'relative microbiota maturity index' and 'microbiota-for-age Z-score' that compare postnatal assembly (defined here as maturation) of a child's faecal microbiota relative to healthy children of similar chronologic age. The model was applied to twins and triplets (to test for associations of these indices with genetic and environmental factors, including diarrhoea), children with SAM enrolled in a randomized trial of two food interventions, and children with moderate acute malnutrition. Our results indicate that SAM is associated with significant relative microbiota immaturity that is only partially ameliorated following two widely used nutritional interventions. Immaturity is also evident in less severe forms of malnutrition and correlates with anthropometric measurements. Microbiota maturity indices provide a microbial measure of human postnatal development, a way of classifying malnourished states, and a parameter for judging therapeutic efficacy. More prolonged interventions with existing or new therapeutic foods and/or addition of gut microbes may be needed to achieve enduring repair of gut microbiota immaturity in childhood malnutrition and improve clinical outcomes.},

  volume = {61},
  issn = {13510754},
  abstract = {Nitrifier denitrification (i.e. nitrite reduction by ammonia oxidizers) is one of the biochemical pathways of nitrous oxide (N2O) production. It is increasingly suggested that this pathway may contribute substantially to N2O production in soil, the major source of this greenhouse gas. However, although monoculture studies recognize its potential, methodological drawbacks prohibit conclusive proof that nitrifier denitrification occurs in actual soils. Here we suggest and apply a new isotopic approach to identify its presence in soil. In incubation experiments with 12 soils, N2O production was studied using oxygen (O) and nitrogen (N) isotope tracing, accounting for O exchange. Microbial biomass C and N and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) patterns were analysed to explain potential differences in N2O production pathways. We found that in at least five of the soils nitrifier denitrification must have contributed to N2O production. Moreover, it may even have been responsible for all NH4+-derived N2O in most soils. In contrast, N2O as a by-product of ammonia oxidation contributed very little to total production. Microbial biomass C and N and PLFA-distinguished microbial community composition were not indicative of differences in N2O production pathways. Overall, we show that combined O and N isotope tracing may still provide a powerful tool to understand N2O production pathways, provided that O exchange is accounted for. We conclude that nitrifier denitrification can indeed occur in soils, and may in fact be responsible for the greater proportion of total nitrifier-induced N2O production.},

  abstract = {Microbial communities are at the very basis of life on earth, catalysing biogeochemical reactions driving global nutrient cycles. However, unlike for plants and animals, microbial diversity is not on the biodiversity conservation agenda. The latter, however, would imply that microbial diversity is not under any threat by anthropogenic disturbance or climate change. This maybe a misconception caused by the rudimentary knowledge we have concerning microbial diversity and its role in ecosystem functioning. This perspective paper indentifies major areas with knowledge gaps within the field of environmental microbiology that preclude a comprehension of microbial ecosystems on the level we have for plants and animals. Opportunities and challenges are pointed out to open the microbial black box and to go from descriptive to predictive microbial ecology.},

  volume = {10},
  abstract = {A central challenge in ecology is to understand the relative importance of processes that shape diversity patterns. Compared with aboveground biota, little is known about spatial patterns and processes in soil organisms. Here we examine the spatial structure of communities of small soil eukaryotes to elucidate the underlying stochastic and deterministic processes in the absence of environmental gradients at a local scale. Specifically, we focus on the fine-scale spatial autocorrelation of prominent taxonomic and functional groups of eukaryotic microbes. We collected 123 soil samples in a nested design at distances ranging from 0.01 to 64 m from three boreal forest sites and used 454 pyrosequencing analysis of Internal Transcribed Spacer for detecting Operational Taxonomic Units of major eukaryotic groups simultaneously. Among the main taxonomic groups, we found significant but weak spatial variability only in the communities of Fungi and Rhizaria. Within Fungi, ectomycorrhizas and pathogens exhibited stronger spatial structure compared with saprotrophs and corresponded to vegetation. For the groups with significant spatial structure, autocorrelation occurred at a very fine scale (o2 m). Both dispersal limitation and environmental selection had a weak effect on communities as reflected in negative or null deviation of communities, which was also supported by multivariate analysis, that is, environment, spatial processes and their shared effects explained on average o10\% of variance. Taken together, these results indicate a random distribution of soil eukaryotes with respect to space and environment in the absence of environmental gradients at the local scale, reflecting the dominant role of drift and homogenizing dispersal.},

  issn = {0951-4198},
  abstract = {Isotopic signatures can be used to study sink and source processes of N2O, but the success of this approach is limited by insufficient knowledge on the isotope fractionation factors of the various reaction pathways. We investigated isotope enrichment factors of the N2O-to-N2 step of denitrifica- tion (e) in two arable soils, a silt-loam Haplic Luvisol and a sandy Gleyic Podzol. In addition to the e of 18O(e18O) and of average 15N(ebulk), the e of the 15N site preference within the linear N2O molecule (eSP) was also determined. Soils were anaerobically incubated in gas-tight bottles withN2Oadded to the headspace to induce N2O reduction. Pre-treatment included the removal of NO? 3 to prevent N2O production. Gas samples were collected regularly to determine the dynamics of N2O reduction, the time course of the isotopic signatures of residualN2O, and the associated isotope enrichment factors. To vary reduction rates and associated fractionation factors, several treatments were established including two levels of initial N2O concentration and anaerobic pre-incubation with or without addition of N2O. N2O reduction rates were affected by the soil type and initial N2O concentration. The e18O and ebulk ranged between ?13 and ?20\%, and between ?5 and ?9\%, respectively. Both quantities were more negative in the Gleyic Podzol. The e of the central N position (ea) was always larger than that of the peripheral N-position (eb), giving eSP of ?4to ?8\%. The ranges and variation patterns of e were comparable with those from previous static incubation studies with soils. Moreover, we found a relatively constant ratio between e18O and ebulk which is close to the default ratio of 2.5 that had been previously suggested. The fact that different soils exhibited comparable e under certain conditions suggests that these values could serve to identify N2O reduction from the isotopic fingerprints of N2O emitted from any soil.

  abstract = {Laboratory incubation experiments were conducted to study the influence of easily oxidizable C (glucose) and mineral N (NH4+ and NO3-) on NO emission, evolution of Co-2 and consumption of O-2. A flush of N2O was always observed during the first few hours after the start of soil incubation, which was significantly higher with NH4+ compared to NO3- applications. The increase in N2O emission was attributed mainly to enhanced soil respiration and subsequent O-2 limitation at the microsite level. Application of NH4+ helped to develop denitrifying populations since subsequent additions of NO3- and a C source significantly enhanced N2O emissions. In soils treated with NH4+, N2O emissions declined rapidly, which was related to decreasing concentrations of easily oxidizable C. Addition of glucose in different amounts and pre-incubation of soil for different lengths of time (to create variation in the amount of easily oxidizable C) changed the pattern of N2O emissions, which was ascribed to changes in soil respiration.},

  issn = {13541013},
  abstract = {Soil microbial communities are the key drivers of many terrestrial biogeochemical processes. However, we currently lack a generalizable understanding of how these soil communities will change in response to predicted increases in global temperatures and which microbial lineages will be most impacted. Here, using high-throughput marker gene sequencing of soils collected from 18 sites throughout North America included in a 100-day laboratory incubation experiment, we identified a core group of abundant and nearly ubiquitous soil microbes that shift in relative abundance with elevated soil temperatures. We then validated and narrowed our list of temperature-sensitive microbes by comparing the results from this laboratory experiment with data compiled from 210 soils representing multiple, independent global field studies sampled across spatial gradients with a wide range in mean annual temperatures. Our results reveal predictable and consistent responses to temperature for a core group of 189 ubiquitous soil bacterial and archaeal taxa, with these taxa exhibiting similar temperature responses across a broad range of soil types. These microbial `bioindicators' are useful for understanding how soil microbial communities respond to warming and to discriminate between the direct and indirect effects of soil warming on microbial communities. Those taxa that were found to be sensitive to temperature represented a wide range of lineages and the direction of the temperature responses were not predictable from phylogeny alone, indicating that temperature responses are difficult to predict from simply describing soil microbial communities at broad taxonomic or phylogenetic levels of resolution. Together, these results lay the foundation for a more predictive understanding of how soil microbial communities respond to soil warming and how warming may ultimately lead to changes in soil biogeochemical processes.},

  abstract = {Rapid immobilization of inorganic nitrogen (N) in soil contributes to ecosystem N accumulation, even in old-growth and chronically-fertilized forests once thought to have poor N retention capacity. In old-growth conifer and hardwood stands in Pennsylvania, we tested the hypotheses that biotic and abiotic N immobilization are regulated by N form and forest type. We added 15NH4+, 15NO2-, and 15NO3- to sterile ({$\gamma$}-irradiated) and live organic-horizon soil and define N immobilization as the mass of added 15N remaining in soil following extractions conducted 15 min, 24 h, and 21 days later. Immobilization of NO2- (19-25\% of added N) occurred in sterile soils within 15 min and was little changed thereafter. Tracer NO3- immobilization was not observed, although soils had been pretreated (refrigerated) so as to quantify the lower limit of immobilization potential. Immobilization of NH4+ (27\%) occurred in live conifer soils by 21 days but not in other treatments. In 21-day incubations, tracer N immobilization was greater in NO3--poor and humic-rich soils. Immobilization was greater in sterile than in live soil, perhaps owing to artifacts of sterilization. Conifer stands exhibited more massive O-horizons, so NO2- immobilization per unit area was greater in conifer (1.46 mg N m-2) than hardwood (0.43 mg N m-2) stands, possibly accounting for lower N leaching from conifer forests. Areal immobilization rates appear to be fast enough to retain all N transformed to NO2-, so NO2- production may be a limiting step in soil N retention in old-growth ecosystems. \textcopyright{} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

This is an approach that should prove fruitful for leveraging genomic information to predict the functional attributes of individual taxa.

The study design included site-based replication of the serpentine-to-nonserpentine community comparison over a regional scale ( approximately 100 km) in Northern California and Southern Oregon by producing 16S rRNA clone libraries from pairs of samples taken on either side of the serepentine-nonserpentine edaphic boundary at three geographical sites. At the division level, the serpentine and nonserpentine communities were similar to each other and to previous data from forest soils. Comparisons of both richness and Shannon diversity produced no significant differences between any of the libraries, but the vast majority of phylogenetically based tests were significant, even with only 50 sequences per library. These results suggest that most samples were distinct, consisting of a collection of lineages generally not found in other samples. The pattern of results showed that serpentine communities tended to be more similar to each other than they were to nonserpentine communities, and these differences were at a lower taxonomic scale. Comparisons of two nonserpentine communities generally showed differences, and some results suggest that the geographical site may control community composition as well. These results show the power of phylogenetic tests to discern differences between 16S rRNA libraries compared to tests that discard DNA data to bin sequences into operational taxonomic units, and they stress the importance of replication at larger scales for inferences regarding microbial biogeography.},

  abstract = {Mixed responses of soil nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes to reduced tillage/no-till are widely reported across soil types and regions. In a field experiment on a Danish sandy loam soil we compared N2O emissions during winter barley growth following five years of direct drilling (DD), reduced tillage (RT) or conventional tillage (CT). Each of these tillage treatments further varied in respect to whether the resulting plot crop residues were retained (+Res) or removed (-Res). Sampling took place from autumn 2007 to the end of spring 2008. Overall N2O emissions were 27 and 26\% lower in DD and RT, respectively, relative to N2O emissions from CT plots (P  0.05). We observed that in residue removal scenarios N2O emissions were similar for all tillage treatments, but in residue retention scenarios N2O emissions were significantly higher in CT than in either DD or RT (P  0.05). Irrespective of residue management, N2O emissions from DD and RT plots never exceeded emissions from CT plots. Retention of residue was estimated to reduce emissions from DD plots by 39\% and in RT plots by 9\%, but to increase N2O emissions from the CT plots by 35\%. Relative soil gas diffusivity (Rdiff), soil NO3-N, soil temperature, tillage and residue were important driving factors for N2O emission (P  0.05). A multiple linear regression model using Rdiff to represent the water factor explained N2O emissions better than a water-filled pore space (WFPS) based model, suggesting a need for review of the current use of WFPS in N2O prediction models. We conclude that on light textured soils, no-till has the potential for reducing N2O emissions when crop residues are returned to the soil. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  issn = {0308-521X},
  abstract = {a b s t r a c t Available online xxxx Agricultural systems science generates knowledge that allows researchers to consider complex problems or take informed agricultural decisions. The rich history of this science exemplifies the diversity of systems and scales over which they operate and have been studied. Modeling, an essential tool in agricultural systems science, has been accomplished by scientists from a wide range of disciplines, who have contributed concepts and tools over more than six decades. As agricultural scientists now consider the " next generation " models, data, and knowledge products needed to meet the increasingly complex systems problems faced by society, it is important to take stock of this history and its lessons to ensure that we avoid re-invention and strive to consider all dimen-sions of associated challenges. To this end, we summarize here the history of agricultural systems modeling and identify lessons learned that can help guide the design and development of next generation of agricultural system tools and methods. A number of past events combined with overall technological progress in other fields have strongly contributed to the evolution of agricultural system modeling, including development of process-based bio-physical models of crops and livestock, statistical models based on historical observations, and economic op-timization and simulation models at household and regional to global scales. Characteristics of agricultural sys-tems models have varied widely depending on the systems involved, their scales, and the wide range of purposes that motivated their development and use by researchers in different disciplines. Recent trends in broader collaboration across institutions, across disciplines, and between the public and private sectors suggest that the stage is set for the major advances in agricultural systems science that are needed for the next generation of models, databases, knowledge products and decision support systems. The lessons from history should be con-sidered to help avoid roadblocks and pitfalls as the community develops this next generation of agricultural sys-tems models.},

  abstract = {Do glaciers enhance or inhibit chemical weathering rates relative to other environments? The importance of glaciers in the global carbon cycle and climate change hinges on the an- swer. We show that catchments occupied by active alpine glaciers yield cation denudation rates greater than the global mean rate but do not exceed rates in nonglacial catchments with similar water discharge. Silica denudation rates are distinctly lower in glacier-covered catch- ments than in their nonglacial counterparts. Because sediment yields are high from glaciers, this suggests that water flux, rather than physical erosion, exerts the primary control on chemical erosion by glaciers. Potassium and calcium concentrations are high relative to other cations in glacial water, probably due to dissolution of soluble trace phases, such as carbon- ates, exposed by comminution, and cation leaching from biotite. Preferential weathering of bi- otite may result in higher 87Sr/86Sr in glacial runoff than expected from whole-rock composi- tions. Thus, although glaciers do not influence total chemical denudation rates at a given runoff, they may yield compositionally distinctive chemical fluxes to the oceans. Disruption of mineral lattices by grinding increases dissolution rates; this and high surface area should make glacial sediments exceptionally weatherable. Weathering of glacial erosion products in environments beyond the glacier margin deserves attention because it may figure prominently in global chemical cycles},

The model uses the annual rates of major N flux processes in the soil-plant system to determine the potentially leachable N pool (mineral N and mineralisable N), and estimates the N leaching loss based on measured relationships between the N leaching loss and the potentially leachable N in the soil. The N flux processes considered in the model include fertiliser or effluent N applications, biological N fixation, soil N mineralisation and immobilisation, plant N uptake, animal N return at the urine patches, ammonium volatilisation, and denitrification. The impact of drainage on N leaching is taken into account by normalising the N leaching loss to a per 100 mm drainage basis. A quadratic equation is used to describe the relationship between the N leaching loss and potentially leachable N. Tests of the model predictions against other experimental data sh...},

  volume = {113},
  issn = {01681923},
  abstract = {Allocation of C to belowground plant structures is one of the most important, yet least well quantified fluxes of C in terrestrial ecosystems. In a literature review of mature forests worldwide, Raich and Nadelhoffer (1989) suggested that total belowground carbon allocation (TBCA) could be estimated from the difference between annual rates of soil respiration and aboveground litterfall. Here we analyze new measurements of soil respiration and litterfall, including data from the Ameriflux network. Our results generally agree with Raich and Nadelhoffer's previous work. A regression analysis of data from mature forests produced the following relationship: annual soil respiration = 287 + 2.80 ?? annual litterfall. This regression slope indicates that, on average, soil respiration is roughly three times aboveground litterfall-C, which further implies that TBCA is roughly twice annual aboveground litterfall-C. These inferences are based on the uncertain assumption of soil C stocks being at steady state. Nevertheless, changes in soil C would have to be very large to modify the conclusion that TBCA is generally much larger than litterfall. Among only mature temperate hardwood forests, however, the correlation between litterfall and soil respiration was poor, and the correlation among years for a single site was also poor. Therefore, the regression cannot be relied upon to provide accurate estimates of soil respiration or TBCA for individual sites. Moreover, interannual variation in TBCA, short-term changes in C stocks, or different temporal scales controlling leaf litter production and soil respiration may cause important deviations from the global average. The regression slope for data from young forests is steeper, possibly indicating proportionally greater TBCA, but the steady-state assumption is more problematic for young forests. This method for estimating TBCA may be most appropriate where interannual variation is averaged over several years of observations and where a near-steady-state assumption of soil, litter, and root C stocks is least problematic. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Low concentrations of NO3- delay reduction of N2O to N2 by soil microorganisms, and high concentrations of NO3- almost completely inhibit this process. The inhibitory effect of NO3- on N2O reduction increases markedly with decrease in soil pH. These observations account for the finding in previous work that accumulation of N2O during denitrification of NO3- in soils incubated in closed systems is favored by high NO3- concentration and by low pH. They also indicate that, even if increased N fertilization of soils does not lead to a significant increase in the amount of N volatilized from soils as N2 and N2O through denitrification of NO3-, it may cause a substantial increase in the ratio of N2O to N2 and thereby pose a threat to the stratospheric ozone layer. ?? 1978.},

Due to their high dispersal ability, high reproduction rates and low rates of extinction microorganisms tend to be widely distributed, and they are thought to be virtually cosmopolitan and selected primarily by environmental factors. Recent studies have shown that, despite these characteristics, microorganisms may behave like larger organisms and exhibit geographical distribution. In this study, we searched patterns of spatial diversity distribution of bacteria and archaea in a contiguous environment. We collected 26 samples of a lake sediment, distributed in a nested grid, with distances between samples ranging from 0.01 m to 1000 m. The samples were analyzed using T-RFLP (Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism) targeting mcrA (coding for a subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase) and the genes of Archaeal and Bacterial 16S rRNA. From the qualitative and quantitative results (relative abundance of operational taxonomic units) we calculated the similarity index for each pair to evaluate the taxa-area and distance decay relationship slopes by linear regression. All results were significant, with mcrA genes showing the highest slope, followed by Archaeal and Bacterial 16S rRNA genes. We showed that the microorganisms of a methanogenic community, that is active in a contiguous environment, display spatial distribution and a taxa-area relationship.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in soil C saturation concepts have increased our understanding of soil C storage and mineralization without explicit links to N retention and saturation theories. Here, we exploit soil tex- ture and organic matter (OM) gradients in a Maryland, USA hardwood forest to test hypotheses that link soil organic C saturation with soil 15N retention and nitrification. At our site, mineral- associated OM (MAOM) N concentrations in the silt + clay particle fraction (g MAOM-N g silt + clay-1) were negatively correlated with the fraction of NH4-N transferred to MAOM during a 3-day in situ incubation (R = -0.85), but positively corre- lated with potential net nitrification (R = 0.76). Moreover, the fraction of NH4-N transferred to MAOM was negatively correlated with potential net nitrification (R = -0.76). Due to physico- chemical stabilization mechanisms, MAOM is considered to be resistant to mineralization. Carbon saturation theory suggests that the proportion of new C inputs that can be stabilized in MAOM decreases in proportion to the amount of C already present in the fraction; C inputs not stabilized in MAOM are susceptible to rapid mineralization. We demonstrate that NH4-N stabilization in MAOM is similar to C stabilization in MAOM and associated with nitrification, thereby extending soil C saturation theory to mineral N and linking it with N retention and saturation theories. These data and concepts complement N saturation models that emphasize vegetation type, N input levels, and microbial turnover. Incorporating the OM retention capacity of fine mineral particles into N satu- ration theory can improve predictions of N saturation rates and resolve inconsistent relationships between soil organic matter, texture, N mineralization, and N retention.},

  abstract = {This protocol addresses N2O, CO2 and CH4 flux measurement by soil chamber methodology. The reactivities of other gasses of interest such as NOx O3, CO, and NH3 will require different chambers and associated instrumentation. Carbon dioxide is included as an analyte with this protocol; however, when plants are present, interpretation of soil CO2 flux data in the context of net GHG flux is not straightforward because soil CO2 emissions do not represent net ecosystem CO2-C exchange. This protocol adopts chamber-based flux methodology (the least expensive option available) in order to allow inclusion of as many sites as possible. Since micrometeorological techniques require expensive instrumentation, they will be used only at locations with current micrometeorological capability. In deciding on a chamber design, our goal was to adopt methodology which is sensitive, unbiased, has low associated variance, and allows accurate interpolation/extrapolation over time and space. Because of our inability, at this time, to precisely assess the extent of bias associated with a given chamber design and sampling protocol under the range of conditions which might exist, we have adopted our 'best guess' protocol. Assessment, refinement and/or modifications of this protocol may continue in the future. At some sites this may include evaluation of chambers against fluxes determined by micrometeorology or performing comparisons of alternate chamber designs. Recognizing that any measurement technique will have disadvantages, the best we can do at this time is to select a technique which minimizes potential problems. In addition, adoption of common methodology will aid in site inter-comparisons. To facilitate the adoption of a common technique, it is important to attain a common understanding of the potential shortcomings associated with chamber-based flux measurement techniques (Rochette and Eriksen-Haamel, 2008).

Abstract. -Frequency-dependent selection on warning color can maintain narrow hybrid zones between unpalatable prey taxa. To measure such selection, we transferred marked Heliconius erato (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) in both directions across a 1 0-km-wide hybrid zone between Peruvian races differing in color pattern. These experimental H. erato were released at four sites, along with control H. erato of the phenotype native to each site. Survival of experimental butterflies was significantly lower than that of controls at two sites and overall. Most selection, measured as differences in survival, occurred soon after release. Selection against foreign morphs was 52\% (confidence limits: 25-7 1 \%) and was probably due to bird attacks on unusual warning-color morphs (more than 10\% of the recaptures had beak marks). Since only three major loci determine the color-pattern differences, this suggests an average selection coefficient of 0.17 per locus, sufficient to maintain the narrow clines in H. erato.},

  volume = {17},

  abstract = {[1] Photosynthesis and respiration impart distinct isotopic signatures to the atmosphere that are used to constrain global carbon source/sink estimates and partition ecosystem fluxes. Increasingly, the ``Keeling plot'' method is being used to determine the carbon isotope composition of ecosystem respiration (d13CR) in order to better understand the processes controlling ecosystem isotope discrimination. In this paper we synthesize emergent patterns in d13CR by analyzing 146 Keeling plots constructed at 33 sites across North and South America. In order to interpret results from disparate studies, we discuss the assumptions underlying the Keeling plot method and recommend standardized methods for determining d13CR. These include the use of regression calculations that account for error in the x variable, and constraining estimates of d13CR to nighttime periods. We then recalculate d13CR uniformly for all sites. We found a high degree of temporal and spatial variability in C3 ecosystems, with individual observations ranging from ?19.0 to ?32.6\{\textbackslash\%\}. Mean C3 ecosystem discrimination was 18.3\{\textbackslash\%\}. Precipitation was a major driver of both temporal and spatial variability of d13CR, suggesting (1) a large influence of recently fixed carbon on ecosystem respiration and (2) a significant effect of previous climatic effects on d13CR. These results illustrate the importance of water availability as a key control on atmospheric 13CO2 and highlight the potential of d13CR as a useful tool for integrating environmental effects on dynamic canopy and ecosystem processes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Much evidence suggests that plant communities on infertile soils are relatively insensitive to increased water deficit caused by increasing temperature and/or decreasing precipitation. However, a multi-decadal study of community change in the western USA does not support this conclusion. This paper tests explanations related to macroclimatic differences, overstorey effects on microclimate, variation in soil texture and plant functional traits.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nMETHODS: A re-analysis was undertaken of the changes in the multi-decadal study, which concerned forest understorey communities on infertile (serpentine) and fertile soils in an aridifying climate (southern Oregan) from 1949-1951 to 2007-2008. Macroclimatic variables, overstorey cover and soil texture were used as new covariates. As an alternative measure of climate-related change, the community mean value of specific leaf area was used, a functional trait measuring drought tolerance. We investigated whether these revised analyses supported the prediction of lesser sensitivity to climate change in understorey communities on infertile serpentine soils.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nKEY RESULTS: Overstorey cover, but not macroclimate or soil texture, was a significant covariate of community change over time. It strongly buffered understorey temperatures, was correlated with less change and averaged 50~\% lower on serpentine soils, thereby counteracting the lower climate sensitivity of understorey herbs on these soils. Community mean specific leaf area showed the predicted pattern of less change over time in serpentine than non-serpentine communities.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS: Based on the current balance of evidence, plant communities on infertile serpentine soils are less sensitive to changes in the climatic water balance than communities on more fertile soils. However, this advantage may in some cases be lessened by their sparser overstorey cover.},

  volume = {172},
  issn = {00167037},
  abstract = {The arrangement of isotopes within a collection of molecules records their physical and chemical histories. Clumped-isotope analysis interrogates these arrangements, i.e., how often rare isotopes are bound together, which in many cases can be explained by equilibrium and/or kinetic isotope fractionation. However, purely combinatorial effects, rooted in the statistics of pairing atoms in a closed system, are also relevant, and not well understood. Here, I show that combinatorial isotope effects are most important when two identical atoms are neighbors on the same molecule (e.g., O2, N2, and D-D clumping in CH4). When the two halves of an atom pair are either assembled with different isotopic preferences or drawn from different reservoirs, combinatorial effects cause depletions in clumped-isotope abundance that are most likely between zero and -1???, although they could potentially be -10??? or larger for D-D pairs. These depletions are of similar magnitude, but of opposite sign, to low-temperature equilibrium clumped-isotope effects for many small molecules. Enzymatic isotope-pairing reactions, which can have site-specific isotopic fractionation factors and atom reservoirs, should express this class of combinatorial isotope effect, although it is not limited to biological reactions. Chemical-kinetic isotope effects, which are related to a bond-forming transition state, arise independently and express second-order combinatorial effects related to the abundance of the rare isotope. Heteronuclear moeties (e.g., CO and CH), are insensitive to direct combinatorial influences, but secondary combinatorial influences are evident. In general, both combinatorial and chemical-kinetic factors are important for calculating and interpreting clumped-isotope signatures of kinetically controlled reactions. I apply this analytical framework to isotope-pairing reactions relevant to geochemical oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen cycling that may be influenced by combinatorial clumped-isotope effects. These isotopic signatures, manifest as either directly bound isotope "clumps" or as features of a molecule's isotopic anatomy, are linked to molecular mechanisms and may eventually provide additional information about biogeochemical cycling on environmentally relevant spatial scales.},

  volume = {19},
  issn = {14622920},
  abstract = {Glacier ecosystems are teeming with life on, beneath, and to a lesser degree, within their icy masses. This conclusion largely stems from polar research, with less attention paid to mountain glaciers that overlap environmentally and ecologically with their polar counterparts in some ways, but diverge in others. One difference lies in the susceptibility of mountain glaciers to the near-term threat of climate change, as they tend to bemuch smaller in both area and volume. Moreover, mountain glaciers are typically steeper, more dependent upon basal sliding for movement, and experience higher seasonal precipitation. Here, we provide a modern synthesis of the microbial ecology ofmountain glacier ecosystems, and particularly those at low- to mid-latitudes. We focus on five ecological zones: the supraglacial surface, englacial interior, subglacial bedrock\textendash{}ice interface, proglacial streams and glacier forefields. For each, we discuss the role of microbiota in biogeochemical cycling and outline ecological and hydrological connections among zones, underscoring the interconnected nature of these ecosystems. Collectively, we highlight the need to: better document the biodiversity and functional roles of mountain glacier microbiota; describe the ecological implications of rapid glacial retreat under climate change and resolve the relative contributions of ecological zones to broader ecosystemfunction.},

  title = {Microbial Legacies Alter Decomposition in Response to Simulated Global Change},
  volume = {11},
  abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystem models assume that microbial communities respond instantaneously, or are immediately resilient, to environmental change. Here we tested this assumption by quantifying the resilience of a leaf litter community to changes in precipitation or nitrogen availability. By manipulating composition within a global change experiment, we decoupled the legacies of abiotic parameters versus that of the microbial community itself. After one rainy season, more variation in fungal composition could be explained by the original microbial inoculum than the litterbag environment (18\% versus 5.5\% of total variation). This compositional legacy persisted for 3 years, when 6\% of the variability in fungal composition was still explained by the microbial origin. In contrast, bacterial composition was generally more resilient than fungal composition. Microbial functioning (measured as decomposition rate) was not immediately resilient to the global change manipulations; decomposition depended on both the contemporary environment and rainfall the year prior. Finally, using metagenomic sequencing, we showed that changes in precipitation, but not nitrogen availability, altered the potential for bacterial carbohydrate degradation, suggesting why the functional consequences of the two experiments may have differed. Predictions of how terrestrial ecosystem processes respond to environmental change may thus be improved by considering the legacies of microbial communities.},

To meet the world's future food security and sustainability needs, food production must grow substantially while, at the same time, agriculture's environmental footprint must shrink dramatically. Here we analyse solutions to this dilemma, showing that tremendous progress could be made by halting agricultural expansion, closing 'yield gaps' on underperforming lands, increasing cropping efficiency, shifting diets and reducing waste. Together, these strategies could double food production while greatly reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture.},

  abstract = {abstract abstract-type="summary" The physical, chemical, and biological soil environment for reduced or no-till farming differs greatly from that for conventional tillage. Evaluation of the soil microbial and biochemical environment greatly aids predictions of N availability to crop plants and in optimizing management practices for reduced and no-till soils. Surface soils from long-term no-till and conventional tillage plots at seven U.S. locations were characterized for microbial and biochemical components. The counts of aerobic micro-organisms, facultative anaerobes, and denitrifiers in the surface (0\textendash{}7.5 cm) of no-till soils were 1.14 to 1.58, 1.57, and 7.31 times higher, respectively, than in the surface of plowed soil. Phosphatase and dehydrogenase enzyme activities and contents of water and organic C and N in the surface of no-till soil were also significantly higher than those for conventional tillage. However, at the 7.5- to 15-cm and 15- to 30-cm depths these trends were reversed and microbial populations, enzyme activities, and water and organic C and N contents were the same or higher for conventional tillage than for no-till. The trends in microbial populations with both tillage treatments were closely paralleled by soil enzyme activities and were also regulated by soil pH and levels of organic C and N. The surface 0- to 7.5-cm of no-till soil contained more potentially mineralizable N\textemdash{}20 to 101 kg/ha\textemdash{}than did that of plowed soils. This increased labile N reserve is apparently related to the higher microbial biomass present under no-till soils. Maximum aerobic microbial activity with conventional tillage extends to a greater depth than with no-till. Microbial populations under no-till decrease rapidly below the 7.5-cm depth. At the 7.5- to 15-cm depth counts of aerobic microor-ganisms and nitrifiers were 1.32 to 1.82 times higher on the conventionally tilled soils. However, counts for facultative anaerobes and denitrifiers were 1.23 to 1.77 times higher for no-till soil. Also, the proportion of the total aerobic population represented by facultative anaerobes and denitrifiers for no-till was twice that for conventional tillage. Consequently the potential rate of mineralization and nitrification is higher with conventional tillage while that for denitrification is higher with no-till. Microbial population counts and the relative abundance of various microbial types suggests that the bochemical environment of no-till soils is less oxidative than that under conventional tillage. Changes in tillage and fertilizer management practices required for no-till soils should reflect the increased potential for immobilization of surface applied N and the lower levels of plant available NOsub arrange="stagger"3sup arrange="stagger"- as compared with those under conventional tillage.},

  abstract = {Soil drying and rewetting impose a significant stress on the soil microbial community. While wetting events are common in most environments, the short and long-term effects of soil rewetting on microbial processes have not been well studied. Furthermore, it is not clear if stress history is important to consider when modeling microbial controls on ecosystem dynamics. In this experiment, we manipulated the frequency of soil rewetting events during 2 months to determine how stress history influences the response of soil microbial communities to rewetting events. Two soils were collected from the Sedgwick Ranch Natural Reserve in Santa Ynez, CA, one from an annual grassland, the other from underneath an oak canopy. Soils were incubated in the lab and went through either 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, or 15 drying-rewetting cycles over 2 months. Soil moisture content was adjusted so that the average moisture content over the course of the incubation was the same for all samples, compensating for the number of drying-rewetting cycles. Soils were analyzed for respiration rate, substrate utilization efficiency, nitrification potential, microbial biomass, and NH4+ and NO3- concentrations. Total CO2 loss during incubation significantly increased with number of rewetting events for oak soils but not for grass soils, where a large number of rewetting events decreased total CO2 loss. Exposure to frequent drying-rewetting events decreased the amount of CO2 released upon rewetting and dramatically increased the activity of autotrophic nitrifier populations. For up to 6 weeks after the last drying-rewetting cycle, respiration rates in soils exposed to a history of drying-rewetting events were substantially lower than their non-stressed controls. In all cases, the effects of the rewetting stress were greater in oak than in grass soils. The results indicate that drying-rewetting events can induce significant changes in microbial C and N dynamics and these effects can last for more than a month after the last stress. The frequency of drying-rewetting stress events has important ecosystem-level ramifications and should be incorporated into models of soil microbial dynamics. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Comparative analyses of 31 fungal genomes (12 generated for this study) suggest that lignin-degrading peroxidases expanded in the lineage leading to the ancestor of the Agaricomycetes, which is reconstructed as a white rot species, and then contracted in parallel lineages leading to brown rot and mycorrhizal species.

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) loss from agriculture impacts ecosystems worldwide. One strategy to mitigate these losses, ecologically based nutrient management (ENM), seeks to recouple carbon (C) and N cycles to reduce environmental losses and supply N to cash crops. However, our capacity to apply ENM is limited by a lack of field-based high-resolution data on N dynamics in actual production contexts. We used data from a five-year study of organic cropping systems to investigate soil inorganic N (SIN) variability and nitrate (NO3-) leaching in ENM. Four production systems initiated in 2007 and 2008 in central Pennsylvania varied in crop rotation, timing and intensity of tillage, inclusion of fallow periods, and N inputs. Extractable SIN was measured fortnightly from March through November throughout the experiment, and NO3-N concentration below the rooting zone was sampled with lysimeters during the first year of the 2008 start. We used recursive partitioning models to assess the importance of management and environmental factors to SIN variability and NO3- leaching and identify interactions between influential variables. Air temperature and tillage were the most important drivers of SIN across systems. The highest SIN concentrations occurred when the average air temperature three weeks prior to measurement was above 21\textdegree{}C. Above this temperature and within 109 days of moldboard plowing, average SIN concentrations were 22.1 mg N/kg soil; 109 days or more past plowing average SIN dropped to 7.7 mg N/kg soil. Other drivers of SIN dynamics were N available from manure and cover crops. Highest average leachate NO3-N concentrations (15.2 ppm) occurred in fall and winter when SIN was above 4.9 mg/kg six weeks prior to leachate collection. Late season tillage operations leading to elevated SIN and leachate NO3-N concentrations were a strategy to reduce weeds while meeting consumer demand for organic products. Thus, while tillage that incorporates organic N inputs preceding cash crops can promote synchrony of N mineralization and crop demand, late or post-season tillage promotes NO3- leaching by stimulating SIN pulses that are asynchronous with plant uptake.},

Sediment was incubated in microcosms at 6 Eh levels (-200, -100, 0, +100, +250 and +400mV) ranging from strongly reducing to moderately oxidizing conditions. Denitrification was determined using the substrate-induced respiration (SIR) inhibition and acetylene inhibition methods. Cycloheximide (C15H23NO4) was used as the fungal inhibitor and streptomycin (C21H39N7O12) as the bacterial inhibitor. At Eh values of +250mV and +400mV, denitrification rates by fungi and bacteria were 34.3-35.1\% and 1.46-1.59\% of total denitrification, respectively, indicating that fungi were responsible for most of the denitrification under aerobic or weakly reducing conditions. On the other hand, at Eh -200mV, denitrification rates of fungi and bacteria were 17.6\% and 64.9\% of total denitrification, respectively, indicating that bacteria were responsible for most of the denitrification under strongly reducing conditions. Results show fungal denitrification was dominant under moderately reducing to weakly oxidizing conditions (Eh+250mV), whereas bacterial denitrification was dominant under strongly reducing condition (Eh-100 mV). At Eh values between -100 to +100 mV, denitrification by fungi and bacteria were 37.9-43.2\% and 53.0-51.1\% of total denitrification, respectively, indicating that both bacteria and fungi contributed significantly to denitrification under these redox conditions. Because N2O is an important gaseous denitrification product in sediment, fungal denitrification could be of greater ecological significance under aerobic or moderately reducing conditions contributing to greenhouse gas emission and global warming potential (GWP). ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The continuous increase of nitrous oxide (N2O) abundance in the atmosphere is a global concern. Multiple pathways of N2O production occur in soil, but their significance and dependence on oxygen (O2) availability and nitrogen (N) fertilizer source are poorly understood. We examined N2O and nitric oxide (NO) production under 21\%, 3\%, 1\%, 0.5\%, and 0\% (vol/vol) O2 concentrations following urea or ammonium sulfate [(NH4)2SO4] additions in loam, clay loam, and sandy loam soils that also contained ample nitrate. The contribution of the ammonia (NH3) oxidation pathways (nitrifier nitrification, nitrifier denitrification, and nitrification-coupled denitrification) and heterotrophic denitrification (HD) to N2O production was determined in 36-h incubations in microcosms by (15)N-(18)O isotope and NH3 oxidation inhibition (by 0.01\% acetylene) methods. Nitrous oxide and NO production via NH3 oxidation pathways increased as O2 concentrations decreased from 21\% to 0.5\%. At low (0.5\% and 3\%) O2 concentrations, nitrifier denitrification contributed between 34\% and 66\%, and HD between 34\% and 50\% of total N2O production. Heterotrophic denitrification was responsible for all N2O production at 0\% O2. Nitrifier denitrification was the main source of N2O production from ammonical fertilizer under low O2 concentrations with urea producing more N2O than (NH4)2SO4 additions. These findings challenge established thought attributing N2O emissions from soils with high water content to HD due to presumably low O2 availability. Our results imply that management practices that increase soil aeration, e.g., reducing compaction and enhancing soil structure, together with careful selection of fertilizer sources and/or nitrification inhibitors, could decrease N2O production in agricultural soils.},

  abstract = {Community ecology is often perceived as a "mess, "given the seemingly vast number of processes that can underlie the many patterns of interest, and the apparent uniqueness of each study system. However, at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of species--the subject matter of community ecology--are influenced by only four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal. Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal to drive community dynamics.},

  volume = {10},
  issn = {13541013},
  abstract = {No-tillage (NT) management has been promoted as a practice capable of offsetting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because of its ability to sequester carbon in soils. However, true mitigation is only possible if the overall impact of NT adoption reduces the net global warming potential (GWP) determined by fluxes of the three major biogenic GHGs (i.e. CO2, N2O, and CH4). We compiled all available data of soil-derived GHG emission comparisons between conventional tilled (CT) and NT systems for humid and dry temperate climates. Newly converted NT systems increase GWP relative to CT practices, in both humid and dry climate regimes, and longer-term adoption (10 years) only significantly reduces GWP in humid climates. Mean cumulative GWP over a 20-year period is also reduced under continuous NT in dry areas, but with a high degree of uncertainty. Emissions of N2O drive much of the trend in net GWP, suggesting improved nitrogen management is essential to realize the full benefit from carbon storage in the soil for purposes of global warming mitigation. Our results indicate a strong time dependency in the GHG mitigation potential of NT agriculture, demonstrating that GHG mitigation by adoption of NT is much more variable and complex than previously considered, and policy plans to reduce global warming through this land management practice need further scrutiny to ensure success.},

  volume = {135},

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) is produced in significant quantities in the soils and lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. Unraveling the mechanisms of N2O production in these soils and ponds is of great interest due to the extreme arid and cold conditions, which are hostile to life. Recent studies have shown production of N2O having unique stable isotopic signatures in certain Dry Valley soils through abiotic reduction of nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-) on active surfaces of Fe(II)-containing minerals, a process known as 'chemodenitrification'. In this study, {$\delta$}15N and {$\delta$}18O of N2O, NO2-, and NO3-, as well as the N2O site preference (SP), were measured at three sites to evaluate the role of chemodenitrification in N2O production. The {$\delta$}15N and {$\delta$}18O values in NO3- indicated an atmospheric source, while {$\delta$}15N values in NO2- (-150) were indicative of abiotic reactions. Instead of finding unique SP values for N2O at Dry Valley sites, SP values mostly fell within the range associated with microbial N2O production mechansims. The {$\delta$}15N and {$\delta$}18O of N2O were also within a range of values expected for various biological N2O production mechanisms. However, efforts to detect biological activity in Don Juan Pond (DJP), a hypersaline pond in the Wright Valley, have been largely unsuccessful. We consider two possible scenarios for N2O production at DJP: (1) abiotic production in the pond, or (2) biological production in nearby freshwater and transport to the pond. Although little is known about the isotopic systematics of abiotic N2O production, these results indicate that if the observed N2O was produced by an abiotic mechanism, its isotopic signature is indistinguishable from that expected from a mixture of several microbial processes and thus, the formation pathway cannot be determined from isotopic composition alone. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Should past dependences of the global environmental impacts of agriculture on human population and consumption continue, 10(9) hectares of natural ecosystems would be converted to agriculture by 2050.

Growth media with a pH of 7 and a nitrogen concentration of 3 mM, supplemented with 1 ml of vitamin solution but not with sodium chloride or riboflavin, were the most successful for the isolation of denitrifiers from activated sludge. The use of ethanol or succinate as a carbon source and a molar C/N ratio of 2.5, 20, or 25 were also favorable. After testing of 60 different medium parameter combinations and comparison with each other as well as with the standard medium Trypticase soy agar supplemented with nitrate, three growth media were highly suitable for the cultivation of denitrifying bacteria. All evaluated isolation conditions were used to study the cultivable denitrifier diversity of activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. One hundred ninety-nine denitrifiers were isolated, the majority of which belonged to the Betaproteobacteria (50.4\%) and the Alphaproteobacteria (36.8\%). Representatives of Gammaproteobacteria (5.6\%), Epsilonproteobacteria (2\%), and Firmicutes (4\%) and one isolate of the Bacteroidetes were also found.

  abstract = {Agricultural fields are one of the largest anthropogenic sources of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O). Fungi have been suggested to contribute substantially to N2O emission in terrestrial environments; however, the extent of the fungal contribution and the phylogenetic and physiologic nature of related fungal communities in agricultural fields are largely unknown. This study focused on the large N2O emission from cropland soil that occurs after granular organic fertilizers were applied to the surface. The granular organic fertilizers applied were evidently covered by fungal mycelia. An experiment using a soil microcosm was established to imitate the field observations. N2O emissions following surface organic fertilization were suppressed by 84 and 20\% after the addition of cycloheximide (a fungal inhibitor) and streptomycin (a bacterial inhibitor), respectively, suggesting that fungi provide the main contribution to the observed N2O emission. The population density and community composition of fungi in the surface-fertilized and non-fertilized soils in the field were determined using colony counting, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and subsequent phylogenetic analyses. Thirty-four fungal strains were isolated from the soils, and their N2O producing activities were analyzed. Fungal population density in the surface-fertilized soil (2.6??106CFU/g) was much higher than that in the non-fertilized soil (1.0??105CFU/g). In addition, the fungal community compositions of the soils differed. Actinomucor elegans, Bionectria ochroleuca, Fusarium avenaceum, Fusarium equiseti, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani and Nectria sp. dominated the surface-fertilized soil, and their activity in producing N2O was confirmed. These results suggested that N2O emission after the surface application of granular organic fertilizers in the cropland field mainly resulted from fungal denitrification. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Enhanced primary production results in an accumulation of particulate organic matter, which encourages microbial activity and the consumption of dissolved oxygen in bottom waters.

  title = {Role of Nitrifier Denitrification in the Production of Nitrous Oxide},
  volume = {33},
  issn = {00380717},
  abstract = {Nitrifier denitrification is the pathway of nitrification in which ammonia (NH3) is oxidized to nitrite (NO2-) followed by the reduction of NO2- to nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O) and molecular nitrogen (N2). The transformations are carried out by autotrophic nitrifiers. Thus, nitrifier denitrification differs from coupled nitrification-denitrification, where denitrifiers reduce NO2- or nitrate (NO3-) that was produced by nitrifiers. Nitrifier denitrification contributes to the development of the greenhouse gas N2O and also causes losses of fertilizer nitrogen in agricultural soils. In this review article, present knowledge about nitrifier denitrification is summarized in order to give an exact definition, to spread awareness of its pathway and controlling factors and to identify areas of research needed to improve global N2O budgets. Due to experimental difficulties and a lack of awareness of nitrifier denitrification, not much is known about this mechanism of N2O production. The few measurements carried out so far attribute up to 30\% of the total N2O production to nitrifier denitrification. Low oxygen conditions coupled with low organic carbon contents of soils favour this pathway as might low pH. As nitrifier denitrification can lead to substantial N2O emissions, there is a need to quantify this pathway in different soils under different conditions. New insights attained through quantification experiments should be used in the improvement of computer models to define sets of conditions that show where and when nitrifier denitrification is a significant source of N2O. This may subsequently render the development of guidelines for low-emission farming practices necessary. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract. Microorganisms have a variety of evolutionary adaptations and physiological acclimation mechanisms that allow them to survive and remain active in the face of environmental stress. Physiological responses to stress have costs at the organismal level that can result in altered ecosystem-level C, energy, and nutrient flows. These large-scale impacts result from direct effects on active microbes' physiology and by controlling the composition of the active microbial community. We first consider some general aspects of how microbes experience environmental stresses and how they respond to them. We then discuss the impacts of two important ecosystem-level Stressors, drought and freezing, on microbial physiology and community composition. Even when microbial community response to stress is limited, the physiological costs imposed on soil microbes are large enough that they may cause large shifts in the allocation and fate of C and N. For example, for microbes to synthesize the osmolytes they need to survive a single drought episode they may consume up to 5\% of total annual net primary production in grassland ecosystems, while acclimating to freezing conditions switches Arctic tundra soils from immobilizing N during the growing season to mineralizing it during the winter. We suggest that more effectively integrating microbial ecology into ecosystem ecology will require a more complete integration of microbial physiological ecology, population biology, and process ecology.},

  abstract = {Soil drying and subsequent rewetting induces N mineralization and denitrification, but the effects of the "extent" or "degree" of drying and rewetting remains poorly understood. The impacts of different degrees of soil drying (drying to 45, 30, 20, or 10\% water-filled pore space, WFPS) and subsequent rewetting (rewetting to 75 or 90\% WFPS) on N2O emissions, denitrification, and net N mineralization were investigated. The highest N2O emissions (201 mu g N2O-N kg(-1)) occurred when the soils were dried to 10\% WFPS followed by rewetting to 90\% WFPS, whereas the lowest emissions (4.72 mu g N2O-N kg(-1)) occurred when the soil was dried to 45\% WFPS followed by rewetting to 75\% WFPS. When soil was rewetted from 10 to 90\% WFPS, cumulative N2O emissions over 120 h were 7.4 times greater than when the soil was rewetted from 10 to 75\% WFPS. The proportion of N2O evolved [N2O/(N2O+N-2)] generally increased as the soil dried. Soil rewetting to 75\% WFPS generally produced greater N2O/(N2O+N-2) ratios than rewetting to 90\% WFPS. Net N mineralization rates in soils rewetted to 75\% WFPS significantly increased from 0.78 mg N kg(-1) d(-1) for the soils dried to 45\% WFPS to 1.69 mg N kg(-1) d(-1) for the soils dried to 10\% WFPS. More extensive soil drying and more extensive rewetting stimulated N2O emissions and total denitrification losses, whereas net N mineralization rates were stimulated only by more extensive drying. Management practices which reduce extreme fluctuations in soil water content may consequently reduce N2O and total denitrification losses.},

Here we use a 15N isotope-dilution technique in intact soil cores to measure gross rates of nitrification and microbial assimilation of NO\textendash{} 3 in eleven undisturbed forest ecosystems of New Mexico and Oregon. We found that gross nitrification rates were surprisingly high in all of the forests examined. Net nitrification rates poorly predicted gross rates because the soil microbial communities had the capacity to assimilate almost all of the NO\textendash{} 3 produced. To our knowledge, this is the first report of gross nitrification and NO\textendash{} 3 assimilation rates in intact soil samples from a large number of contrasting forest ecosystems. Our results contradict previous assumptions that nitrification rates are low in mature coniferous forests and suggest that current models greatly underestimate the role of the microbial community in preventing NO\textendash{} 3 loss.},

ABSTRACT: Nitrogen and phosphorus were identified as nutrients limiting the growth of plants in an herbaceous community on serpentine soil. Potassium, sulfur and calcium additions had little or no effect. Nutrients were added, alone and in combina-tion, to plots in the field and to greenhouse pots of serpentine soil containing the annual grasses, Bromus mollis and Vulpia microstachys. The absence of any effect due to added calcium indicates that calcium deficiency is not a universal explanation of the low primary production on serpentine soils.},

  abstract = {The source of N2O in terrestrial ecosystems has long been debated. Both nitrification and denitrification produce N2O but their relative importance remains uncertain. Here we apply site preference, SP (the difference in ??15N between the central and outer N atom in N2O), to estimate the relative importance of bacterial denitrification (including nitrifier denitrification) to total N2O production from soil. We measured SP over a diurnal cycle following the third year of tillage of a previously uncultivated grassland soil at the Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) in southwestern Michigan. Fluxes of N2O in our study ranged between 7.8 and 12.1??g N2O-N??ha-1??d-1 and were approximately 3 and 10 times greater than fluxes observed in managed agricultural and successional fields, respectively, at KBS. Consequently, our study captured a period of high flux resulting from the cultivation of a historically never-tilled soil. Concentration weighted SP values decreased from 12.9??? in the morning to a minimum value of -0.1??? in the afternoon. Based on SP values reported for bacterial denitrification (-5 to 0???; Toyoda et??al., 2005; Sutka et??al., 2006), hydroxylamine oxidation (nitrification) and fungal denitrification (33-37???; Sutka et??al., 2006) we found that production attributable to bacterial denitrification increased from between 52.9 and 60.9\% in the morning to between 87.5 and 100\% in the afternoon. Further, we observed diurnal variation in flux and SP that is consistent with increased production from bacterial denitrification associated with temperature-driven increases in respiration. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Our objectives were to compare the contributions of hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) and NH+4 N sources to NO-3 leaching in corn (Zea mays L.) production, and to compare NO-3 leaching losses in a corn production system utilizing hairy vetch as a N source and winter cover crop with leaching losses in one utilizing an NH+4 N source and a rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop. Nitrogen, sometimes enriched with 15N, was applied to corn grown on a Maury silt loam (fine, mixed, mesic Typic Paleudalf) in lysimeters as vetch- or NH+4-N at rates between 10.5 and 14.0 g N m-2 yr-1. Treatments (N source/cover crop) were: NH+4-N/fallow, vetch-N/fallow, NH+4-N/rye, and vetch-N/vetch; mean 3-yr cumulative NO-3 leaching losses were 6.11, 4.85, 0.35, and 2.51 g N m-2, respectively. Total recovery of added 15N in leachate was 5\% for all treatments, and the percentage of leached NO-3 derived from labeled N sources was generally 15\%. In the winter-fallow lysimeters, effects of N source on the fraction of water input discharged, concentration of NO-3, and quantity of NO-3 leached varied with year and time of year; differences in N-source availability and mulch effects were sometimes indicated. Generally, cover crop effects were larger than N-source effects. The NH+4 N source/rye cover system leached consistently less NO-3 than the vetch N source/vetch cover system, even though the fraction of water discharged was not consistently different.},

Since H{$_3$}AsO{$_{3}^0$} is the predominant As species found in paddy pore-waters, and H{$_4$}SiO{$_{4}^0$} and H{$_3$}AsO{$_{3}^0$} share an uptake pathway, silica amendments have been proposed to decrease As uptake and consequent As concentrations in grains. Here, we evaluated the impact of two silicate mineral additions differing in solubility (+Si(L), diatomaceous earth, 0.29 mM Si; +Si(H), Si-gel, 1.1 mM Si) to soils differing in mineralogy on arsenic concentration in rice. The +Si(L) addition either did not change or decreased As concentration in pore-water but did not change or increased grain-As levels relative to the (+As--Si) control. The +Si(H) addition increased As in pore-water, but it significantly decreased grain-As relative to the (+As--Si) control. Only the +Si(H) addition resulted in significant increases in straw- and husk-Si. Total grain- and straw-As was negatively correlated with pore-water Si, and the relationship differed between two soils exhibiting different mineralogy. These differing results are a consequence of competition between H{$_4$}SiO{$_{4}^0$} and H{$_3$}AsO{$_{3}^0$} for adsorption sites on soil solids and subsequent plant-uptake, and illustrate the importance of Si mineralogy on arsenic uptake.},

  abstract = {The response of soil denitrification to increased soil moisture was compared in a non-aggregated sandy loam soil and an aggregated clay loam soil using a soil core technique and the acetylene inhibition method. Elevated field denitrification rates were observed on 9 of 11 occasions on three sites following irrigation or rainfall of  1 cm water. The denitrification rate in the sandy loam soil increased immediately after water addition and reached a maximum rate within 3\textendash{}5 h and returned to preirrigation levels within 12 h. A similar, but slower denitrification response occurred in the clay loam soil, requiring 8\textendash{}12 h before a maximum rate was observed and 48 h before the original background rate was restored. Maximum denitrification rates of 209 and 383 ng N g\textendash{}1 d\textendash{}1 occurred following water inputs of 7 and 2 cm in the sandy loam and clay loam soils, respectively. These water additions resulted in air-filled porosities of 0.37 m3 m\textendash{}3 in the two soils. Nitrogen losses from the clay loam soil were double that of the sandy loam although the sandy loam received almost twice the water input. This difference was apparently due to the longer duration of the enhanced denitrification rate in the clay loam soil following the increase in the soil moisture. In the two soils 38 and 55\% of the total N loss in late spring occurred within 48 h after rainfalls greater than 1 cm. These studies confirm that significant denitrification losses can occur in bursts in response to rainfall, and illustrate that sampling schemes based on integration of denitrification rate measurements must include these episodes to obtain meaningful estimates of N loss. A denitrification response to rainfall was not always the case, however, suggesting that NO-3 or carbon may also limit nitrogen loss.},

  volume = {145},
  issn = {03784290},
  abstract = {Wheat yields and grain protein content are lower and more variable in organic conditions than in conventional agriculture, mainly due to nitrogen (N) deficiency and weed competition. The undersowing of legume cover crops in growing winter wheat, also known as relay intercropping, is assumed to be a proficient way of enriching the soil-crop system with N and improving weed control. However, competition for resources may impair wheat performance. Relay intercropping in springtime in growing winter wheat is expected to limit competition for resources from the legume. The aim of our study was to analyze wheat performance and resource competition in relay intercropping systems with legume cover crops under various environmental conditions.Eight field experiments were conducted on organic grain-oriented farms located in southeast France. Black medic (Medicago lupulina), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), red clover (Trifolium pratense) and white clover (Trifolium repens), undersown at wheat tillering stage, were compared with a sole crop of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Lona). The aerial biomass of wheat and legumes and total N content of wheat were determined at both the flowering stage and harvest time of the wheat. The main trophic resources (water, N and light) were monitored at similar stages. Wheat grain yield and grain protein content were also measured. Sites were classified according to wheat sole crop performance at harvest to evaluate the effect of relay intercropping in the various conditions tested.In all but one of the thirty-two treatments, wheat grain yield was not significantly disturbed by relay intercropping whatever the aerial development of legumes. Abundant aerial development of legumes after flowering (20\% of the aerial biomass of wheat at harvest) was associated with a mean significant decrease in wheat grain protein content of 8.5\% of the control treatment value, this occurring in one third of the situations. These ratios of aerial biomasses of legumes compared to wheat were also associated with reductions in soil moisture and wheat N uptake. The effect on the availability of trophic resources for wheat may have led to a decrease in grain protein content without having any effect on grain yield. Sites which registered a low performance for wheat sole crops were less negatively impacted by the presence and aerial development of legumes.The performance of the four legume species and the mechanisms of induced disturbance of resource availability are then discussed. Finally, we try to define ranges of legumes' development and resource availability in which wheat performance was maintained or limited. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

These approaches overlook the dramatic change in our understanding of life's diversity resulting fromgenomic sampling of previously unexamined environments. New methods to generate genome sequences illuminate the identity of organisms and their meta- bolic capacities, placing them in community and ecosystem con- texts7,8. Here, we use new genomic data from over 1,000 uncultivated and little known organisms, together with pub- lished sequences, to infer a dramatically expanded version of the tree of life, with Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya included. The depiction is both a global overview and a snapshot of the diversity within each major lineage. The results reveal the dom- inance of bacterial diversification and underline the importance of organisms lacking isolated representatives, with substantial evolution concentrated in a major radiation of such organisms. This tree highlights major lineages currently underrepresented in biogeochemical models and identifies radiations that are probably important for future evolutionary analyses.},

  abstract = {Agriculture in the United States (US) cycles large quantities of nitrogen (N) to produce food, fuel, and fiber and is a major source of excess reactive nitrogen (Nr) in the environment. Nitrogen lost from cropping systems and animal operations moves to waterways, groundwater, and the atmosphere. Changes in climate and climate variability may further affect the ability of agricultural systems to conserve N. The N that escapes affects climate directly through the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), and indirectly through the loss of nitrate (NO3 -), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ammonia to downstream and downwind ecosystems that then emit some of the N received as N2O and NOx. Emissions of NOx lead to the formation of tropospheric ozone, a greenhouse gas that can also harm crops directly. There are many opportunities to mitigate the impact of agricultural N on climate and the impact of climate on agricultural N. Some are available today; many need further research; and all await effective incentives to become adopted. Research needs can be grouped into four major categories: (1) an improved understanding of agricultural N cycle responses to changing climate; (2) a systems-level understanding of important crop and animal systems sufficient to identify key interactions and feedbacks; (3) the further development and testing of quantitative models capable of predicting N-climate interactions with confidence across a wide variety of crop-soil-climate combinations; and (4) socioecological research to better understand the incentives necessary to achieve meaningful deployment of realistic solutions. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Author(s).},

  volume = {4},
  issn = {13541013},
  abstract = {Global change can affect soil processes by either altering the functioning of existing organisms or by restructuring the community, modifying the fundamental physiologies that drive biogeochemical processes. Thus, not only might process rates change, but the controls over them might also change. Moreover, previously insignificant processes could become important. These possibilities raise the question 'Will changes in climate and land use restructure microbial communities in a way that will alter trace gas fluxes from an ecosystem?' Process studies indicate that microbial community structure can influence trace gas dynamics at a large scale. For example, soil respiration and CH4 production both show ranges of temperature response among ecosystems, indicating differences in the microbial communities responsible. There are three patterns of NH4+ inhibition of CH4 oxidation at the ecosystem scale: no inhibition, immediate inhibition, and delayed inhibition; these are associated with different CH4 oxidizer communities. Thus, it is possible that changes in climate, land-use, and disturbance regimes could alter microbial communities in ways that would substantially alter trace gas fluxes; we discuss the data supporting this conclusion. We also discuss approaches to developing research linking microbial community structure and activity to the structure and functioning of the whole ecosystem. Modern techniques allow us to identify active organisms even if they have not been cultivated; in combination with traditional experimental approaches we should be able to identify the linkages between these active populations and the processes they carry out at the ecosystem level. Finally we describe scenarios of how global change could alter trace gas fluxes by altering microbial communities and how understanding the microbial community dynamics could improve our ability to predict future trace gas fluxes.},

This study investigated the effect of altering surface soil dynamics, using a winter cover crop rotation, on biotic and abiotic characteristics of the soil profile. Two cover crop treatments, phacelia and Merced rye (Phacelia tanacetifolia cv. 'Phaci', and Secale cereale cv. 'Merced'), with a fallow control, were planted in November after harvest of a broccoli crop on a commercial farm site, and were incorporated using reduced tillage techniques the following March. Changes in plant and soil N pools throughout the profile were described, emphasizing nitrate (NO3--N) leaching during winter, and N availability during the subsequent broccoli crop. Changes in other aspects of the ecosystem, such as plant-pest interactions and plant disease incidence, were monitored after cover crop incorporation. The on-farm economic costs of cover cropping were calculated. There was a 65-70\% reduction in nitrate leaching from the cover-cropped plots compared with the fallow control during winter, because plant roots in the surface soil removed N and water that would have otherwise been lost from the profile. Incorporation caused sudden large surges in inorganic N pools, net mineralizable N, and microbial biomass N and C in the surface soil, which subsided within 6 weeks, by the time the broccoli crop was planted, but which did result in increased yield at harvest in the phacelia cover-cropped treatment. No insect or disease problems which threatened the cash crops were introduced or increased as a result of the cover crops. The economic analysis indicated that the costs of cover cropping were minor compared with conventional winter management of fallowed fields, and compared with the cost of producing broccoli. The cover crops therefore provided a clear advantage during winter by significantly reducing nitrate leaching, but the effects of one cover crop rotation on subsequent nutrient dynamics in the surface oil were mostly short-lived and possibly masked by large fertilizer applications.},

  volume = {7},
  issn = {1664302X},
  abstract = {Soil microorganisms play important roles in nitrogen cycling within forest ecosystems. Current research has revealed that a wider variety of microorganisms, with unexpected diversity in their functions and phylogenies, are involved in the nitrogen cycle than previously thought, including nitrogen-fixing bacteria, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea, heterotrophic nitrifying microorganisms, and anammox bacteria, as well as denitrifying bacteria, archaea, and fungi. However, the vast majority of this research has been focused in temperate regions, and relatively little is known regarding the ecology of nitrogen-cycling microorganisms within tropical and subtropical ecosystems. Tropical forests are characterized by relatively high precipitation, low annual temperature fluctuation, high heterogeneity in plant diversity, large amounts of plant litter, and unique soil chemistry. For these reasons, regulation of the nitrogen cycle in tropical forests may be very different from that of temperate ecosystems. This is of great importance because of growing concerns regarding the effect of land use change and chronic- elevated nitrogen deposition on nitrogen-cycling processes in tropical forests. In the context of global change, it is crucial to understand how environmental factors and land use changes in tropical ecosystems influence the composition, abundance and activity of key players in the nitrogen cycle. In this review, we synthesize the limited currently available information regarding the microbial communities involved in nitrogen fixation, nitrification and denitrification, to provide deeper insight into the mechanisms regulating nitrogen cycling in tropical forest ecosystems. We also highlight the large gaps in our understanding of microbially mediated nitrogen processes in tropical forest soils and identify important areas for future research.},

  volume = {123},
  issn = {00167037},
  abstract = {Rice is an important staple for over half the world's population, and silicon (Si) is a vital nutrient that helps to improve yields through its role in alleviating biotic and abiotic stresses. Despite Si being abundant in crustal materials, it is only slowly released to soil pore-waters through chemical weathering. However, biocycling of Si through plant material (i.e. phytoliths) and back into soil is comparatively rapid, and thus may exert a dominant control on the biogeochemical cycling of Si within soils and near-surface sediments in some environments. Despite the potential importance of this pathway, Si cycling is poorly resolved in cultivated systems, such as rice cropping. Here, we monitored seasonal trends of Si in pore-water, plants, and soil over a two-year period in a California rice cropping system where straw is incorporated into the soil during the fallow season. There was a clear seasonal trend of high pore-water Si concentrations during the winter fallow that approached predicted equilibrium with amorphous Si, followed by low concentrations during the growing season within the top 20cm of the profile. The seasonal change in Ge/Si ratios from low values during the winter fallow to high values-up to 36??molmol-1-during the growing season was due to a greater change in Si concentrations rather than Ge concentrations. These data indicate a low-[Ge], high-[Si] source of Si during the winter fallow, which may be due to incorporation of rice straw (a low-[Ge], high-[Si] source) and subsequent phytolith dissolution. Our results suggest that incorporation of high-[Si] plant material (e.g. straw) releases additional Si to soil pore-waters that is available for plant-uptake during the growing season. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Producers may be able to reduce inputs for weed management by designing rotations to disrupt population dynamics of weeds. Population-based management in conventional farming has reduced herbicide use by 50\% because weed density declines in cropland across time. In this paper, we suggest a 9-year rotation comprised of perennial forages and annual crops that will disrupt weed population growth and reduce weed density in organic systems. Lower weed density will also improve effectiveness of weed control tactics used for an individual crop. The rotation includes 3-year intervals of no-till, which will improve both weed population management and soil health. Even though this rotation has not been field tested, it provides an example of designing rotations to disrupt population dynamics of weeds. Also, producers may gain additional benefits of higher crop yield and increased nitrogen supply with this rotation design.},

A simple modelling framework was developed to investigate how substrate quality and environmental controls over microbial activity regulate microbial assimilation of soil organic carbon and on the size of the microbial biomass. Substrate quality has a positive effect on microbial assimilation of soil organic carbon: higher substrate quality leads to higher ratio of microbial carbon to soil organic carbon. Microbial biomass carbon peaks and then declines as cumulative activity increases. The simulated ratios of soil microbial biomass to soil organic carbon are reasonably consistent with a recently compiled global data set at the biome level. The modelling framework developed in this study offers a simple approach to incorporate microbial contributions to the carbon cycling into Earth system models to simulate carbon-climate feedbacks and explain global patterns of microbial biomass.},

Net GWP (grams of carbon dioxide equivalents per square meter per year) ranged from 110 in our conventional tillage systems to -211 in early successional communities. None of the annual cropping systems provided net mitigation, although soil carbon accumulation in no-till systems came closest to mitigating all other sources of GWP. In all but one ecosystem, nitrous oxide production was the single greatest source of GWP. In the late successional system, GWP was neutral because of significant methane oxidation.

  issn = {0027-8424},
  abstract = {Global food demand is increasing rapidly, as are the environmental impacts of agricultural expansion. Here, we project global demand for crop production in 2050 and evaluate the environmental impacts of alternative ways that this demand might be met. We find that per capita demand for crops, when measured as caloric or protein content of all crops combined, has been a similarly increasing function of per capita real income since 1960. This relationship forecasts a 100-110\% increase in global crop demand from 2005 to 2050. Quantitative assessments show that the environmental impacts of meeting this demand depend on how global agriculture expands. If current trends of greater agricultural intensification in richer nations and greater land clearing (extensification) in poorer nations were to continue, \~1 billion ha of land would be cleared globally by 2050, with C[O.sub.2]-C equivalent greenhouse gas emissions reaching \~3 Gt [y.sup.-1] and N use \~250 Mt [y.sup.-1] by then. In contrast, if 2050 crop demand was met by moderate intensification focused on existing croplands of underyielding nations, adaptation and transfer of high-yielding technologies to these croplands, and global technological improvements, our analyses forecast land clearing of only \~0.2 billion ha, greenhouse gas emissions of \~1 Gt [y.sup.-1], and global N use of \~225 Mt [y.sup.-1]. Efficient management practices could substantially lower nitrogen use. Attainment of high yields on existing croplands of underyielding nations is of great importance if global crop demand is to be met with minimal environmental impacts. food security | land-use change | biodiversity | climate change | soil fertility doi/10.1073/pnas.1116437108},

Present research has not provided crop production and soils information that is adequately comprehensive and holistic for producers to make critical decisions. We propose a dynamic cropping systems approach to help producers make those critical decisions they need to remain sustainable. Our definition of a dynamic cropping system is a long-term strategy of annual crop sequencing that optimizes crop and soil use options and the attainment of production, economic, and resource conservation goals by using sound ecological management principles. Implicit to this strategy is the need for producers to possess information necessary to respond to continual change. Key factors associated with dynamic cropping systems are diversity, adaptability, reduced input cost, multiple enterprise systems, and awareness of environment and information. Development of a dynamic cropping systems research program involves creating a crop portfolio, crop sequence evaluation, and multidirectional flow of information among research, extension, and producers. Dynamic cropping systems approach relies on responsiveness and provides producers with management flexibility for developing their own long-term sustainable crop, soil, and land use systems.The wise adapt themselves to circumstances, as water moulds itself to a pitcher.

  abstract = {Areas within an agricultural field in the same season often differ in crop productivity despite having the same cropping history, crop genotype, and management practices. One hypothesis is that abiotic or biotic factors in the soils differ between areas resulting in these productivity differences. In this study, bulk soil samples collected from a high and a low productivity area from within six agronomic fields in Illinois were quantified for abiotic and biotic characteristics. Extracted DNA from these bulk soil samples were shotgun sequenced. While logistic regression analyses resulted in no significant association between crop productivity and the 26 soil characteristics, principal coordinate analysis and constrained correspondence analysis showed crop productivity explained a major proportion of the taxa variance in the bulk soil microbiome. Metagenome-wide association studies (MWAS) identified more Bradyrhizodium and Gammaproteobacteria in higher productivity areas and more Actinobacteria, Ascomycota, Planctomycetales, and Streptophyta in lower productivity areas. Machine learning using a random forest method successfully predicted productivity based on the microbiome composition with the best accuracy at the order level (78.7\% accurate). Our study showed that crop productivity differences were associated with bulk soil microbiome composition and highlighted several nitrogen utility-related taxa. We demonstrated the merit of MWAS and machine learning for the first time in plant-microbiome study.},

  volume = {28},
  issn = {08856087},
  abstract = {In the Colorado Front Range, forested catchments near the rain-snow transition are likely to experience changes in snowmelt delivery and subsurface water transport with climate warming and associated shifts in precipitation patterns. Snowpack dynamics are strongly affected by aspect: Lodgepole pine forested north-facing slopes develop a seasonal snowpack, while Ponderosa pine-dotted south-facing slopes experience intermittent snow accumulation throughout winter and spring. We tested the degree to which these contrasting water input patterns cause different near-surface hydrologic response on north- and south-facing hillslopes during the snowmelt period. During spring snowmelt, we applied lithium bromide (LiBr) tracer to instrumented plots along a north-south catchment transect. Bromide broke through immediately at 10 and 30 cm depths on the north-facing slope, and was transported out of soil waters within 40 days. On the south-facing slope, Br- was transported to significant depths only during spring storms, and remained above the detection limit throughout the study. Modeling of unsaturated zone hydrologic response using Hydrus 1-D corroborated these aspect-driven differences in subsurface transport. Our multiple lines of evidence suggest that north-facing slopes are dominated by connected flow through the soil matrix while south-facing slope soils experience brief periods of rapid vertical transport following snowmelt events and are drier overall than north-facing slopes. These differences in hydrologic response were largely a function of energy-driven differences in water supply, emphasizing the importance of aspect and climate forcing when considering contributions of water and solutes to streamflow in catchments near the snow line.

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N20) is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change and stratospheric ozone destruction. Anthropo genic nitrogen (N) loading to river networks is a potentially impor tant source of N20 via microbial denitrification that converts N to N20 and dinitrogen (N2). The fraction of denitrified N that escapes as N20 rather than N2 (i.e., the N20 yield) is an important deter minant of how much N20 is produced by river networks, but little is known about the N20 yield in flowing waters. Here, we present the results of whole-stream 15N-tracer additions conducted in 72 headwater streams draining multiple land-use types across the United States. We found that stream denitrification produces N20 at rates that increase with stream water nitrate (N03\~) con centrations, but that 1\% of denitrified N is converted to N20. Unlike some previous studies, we found no relationship between the N20 yield and stream water N03\~. We suggest that increased stream N03\~ loading stimulates denitrification and concomitant N20 production, but does not increase the N20 yield. In our study, most streams were sources of N20 to the atmosphere and the highest emission rates were observed in streams drain ing urban basins. Using a global river network model, we esti mate that microbial N transformations (e.g., denitrification and nitrification) convert at least 0.68 Tg*{\~y}1 of anthropogenic N inputs to N20 in river networks, equivalent to 10\% of the global anthropogenic N20 emission rate. This estimate of stream and river N20 emissions is three times greater than estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change},

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) is an important greenhouse gas that is emitted from soil, but obtaining precise N(2)O source and sink strength estimates has been difficult due to high spatial and temporal flux variability and a poor understanding of the mechanisms controlling fluxes. Tools that improve our ability to quantify trace gas fluxes from soil and constrain annual budgets are therefore needed. Here we describe an improved chamber-based sampling system that continuously traps evolving soil gases onto molecular sieve thereby obtaining a single sample that integrates fluxes over extended periods (several weeks or more) and the use of stable isotopic methods to study microbial origins of N(2)O. We demonstrate that N(2)O can be trapped on molecular sieve within our chamber system with near 100\% recovery and without isotopic fractionation. In field trials the site preference of N(2)O (the difference in delta(15)N between the central and outer N atoms) varied between -6 and 14.4\%, indicating that the majority of flux was derived from bacterial denitrification. Further development with automation would improve flux estimates by providing a system capable of capturing episodic flux events owing to long-term deployment. Further, an automated trapping chamber approach will also provide process-based understanding of N(2)O dynamics via stable isotopes and a new and affordable tool for evaluating the response of trace gas fluxes to land management practices.},

Site preference was used to evaluate the importance of denitrification (including nitrifier denitrification) in N2O production. Average flux-weighted SP values for each field ranged between 2.9 and 14.6{\^a} and, on the basis of SP values for N2O production from denitrification (0{\^a}) and collectively for nitrification and fungal denitrification (37{\^a}), these values indicate that between 61 and 92\% of N2O originated from denitrification. Reduction of N2O ranged from undetectable to as much as 50\% of production; and because reduction increases SP, our results underestimate the percentage of N2O from bacterial denitrification. The SP values in our study clearly indicate that denitrification is the predominant source of soil-derived N2O.},

  volume = {73},
  abstract = {Biological nitrogen fixation is a fundamental component of the nitrogen cycle and is the dominant natural process through which fixed nitrogen is made available to the biosphere. While the process of nitrogen fixation has been studied extensively with a limited set of cultivated isolates, examinations of nifH gene diversity in natural systems reveal the existence of a wide range of noncultivated diazotrophs. These noncultivated diazotrophs remain uncharacterized, as do their contributions to nitrogen fixation in natural systems. We have employed a novel 15 N 2 -DNA stable isotope probing (5 N 2 -DNA-SIP) method to identify free-living diazotrophs in soil that are responsible for nitrogen fixation in situ. Analyses of 16S rRNA genes from 15 N-labeled DNA provide evidence for nitrogen fixation by three microbial groups, one of which belongs to the Rhizobiales while the other two represent deeply divergent lineages of noncultivated bacteria within the Betaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria, respectively. Analysis of nifH genes from 15 N-labeled DNA also revealed three microbial groups, one of which was associated with Alphaproteobacteria while the others were associated with two noncultivated groups that are deeply divergent within nifH cluster I. These results reveal that noncultivated free-living diazotrophs can mediate nitrogen fixation in soils and that 15 N 2 -DNA-SIP can be used to gain access to DNA from these organisms. In addition, this research provides the first evidence for nitrogen fixation by Actinobac-teria outside of the order Actinomycetales.},

  volume = {16},

  abstract = {Denitrification, the reduction of the nitrogen (N) oxides, nitrate (NO3?) and nitrite (NO2?), to the gases nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and dinitrogen (N2), is important to primary production, water quality, and the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere at ecosystem, landscape, regional, and global scales. Unfortunately, this process is very difficult to measure, and existing methods are problematic for different reasons in different places at different times. In this paper, we review the major approaches that have been taken to measure denitrification in terrestrial and aquatic environments and discuss the strengths, weaknesses, and future prospects for the different methods. Methodological approaches covered include (1) acetylene-based methods, (2) 15N tracers, (3) direct N2 quantification, (4) N2:Ar ratio quantification, (5) mass balance approaches, (6) stoichiometric approaches, (7) methods based on stable isotopes, (8) in situ gradients with atmospheric environmental tracers, and (9) molecular approaches. Our review makes it clear that the prospects for improved quantification of denitrification vary greatly in different environments and at different scales. While current methodology allows for the production of accurate estimates of denitrification at scales relevant to water and air quality and ecosystem fertility questions in some systems (e.g., aquatic sediments, well-defined aquifers), methodology for other systems, especially upland terrestrial areas, still needs development. Comparison of mass balance and stoichiometric approaches that constrain estimates of denitrification at large scales with point measurements (made using multiple methods), in multiple systems, is likely to propel more improvement in denitrification methods over the next few years.},

At other trophic levels, the plant microbiome has been shown to influence host plant fitness and function, and host-associated microbes have been proposed to influence ecosystem function through their role in defining the extended phenotype of host organisms. However, the importance of the plant microbiome for ecosystem function has not been quantified in the context of the known importance of plant diversity and traits. Here, using a tree biodiversity\textendash{}ecosystem functioning experiment, we provide strong support for the hypothesis that leaf bacterial diversity is positively linked to ecosystem productivity, even after accounting for the role of plant diversity. Our results also show that host species identity, functional identity and functional diversity are the main determinants of leaf bacterial community structure and diversity. Our study provides evidence of a positive correlation between plant-associated microbial diversity and terrestrial ecosystem productivity, and a new mechanism by which models of biodiversity\textendash{}ecosystem functioning relationships can be improved.},

  volume = {136},
  issn = {00298549},
  abstract = {Stable isotopes are increasingly being used as tracers in environmental studies. One application is to use isotopic ratios to quantitatively determine the proportional contribution of several sources to a mixture, such as the proportion of various pollution sources in a waste stream. In general, the proportional contributions of n+1 different sources can be uniquely determined by the use of n different isotope system tracers (e.g., {$\delta$}13C, {$\delta$}15N, {$\delta$}18O) with linear mixing models based on mass balance equations. Often, however, the number of potential sources exceeds n+1, which prevents finding a unique solution of source proportions. What can be done in these situations? While no definitive solution exists, we propose a method that is informative in determining bounds for the contributions of each source. In this method, all possible combinations of each source contribution (0-100\%) are examined in small increments (e.g., 1\%). Combinations that sum to the observed mixture isotopic signatures within a small tolerance (e.g., {$\pm$}0.1\textperthousand{}) are considered to be feasible solutions, from which the frequency and range of potential source contributions can be determined. To avoid misrepresenting the results, users of this procedure should report the distribution of feasible solutions rather than focusing on a single value such as the mean. We applied this method to a variety of environmental studies in which stable isotope tracers were used to quantify the relative magnitude of multiple sources, including (1) plant water use, (2) geochemistry, (3) air pollution, and (4) dietary analysis. This method gives the range of isotopically determined source contributions; additional non-isotopic constraints specific to each study may be used to further restrict this range. The breadth of the isotopically determined ranges depends on the geometry of the mixing space and the similarity of source and mixture isotopic signatures. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the estimated ranges vary only modestly with different choices of source increment and mass balance tolerance parameter values. A computer program (IsoSource) to perform these calculations for user-specified data is available at http://www.e-pa.gov/wed/pages/models.htm.},

  volume = {50},
  issn = {01671987},
  abstract = {Annual nitrogen leaching losses from arable land in south Sweden usually amount to 15-45 kg ha-1. The objective of this three-year study was to investigate the timing effect of mouldboard ploughing (early autumn, late autumn or spring) on soil mineral nitrogen content and nitrate leaching in a cropping system with spring-sown small grain crops (barley, oats and wheat). Late autumn ploughing was studied with and without perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) as a catch crop, and with and without preceding stubble cultivation. The effects of removal compared to incorporation of straw were also studied. Soil mineral nitrogen in the 0-90 cm layer was determined on 4-5 occasions each year. Nitrate was determined in soil water sampled with ceramic suction cups at 60 and 90 cm. Total nitrogen in above-ground catch crops, weeds and volunteer plants was determined at ripeness of the main crop and before tillage operations. Time of tillage, as opposed to catch crop or crop residue management, influenced nitrogen leaching. After early tillage, soil mineral nitrogen increased during autumn. In November, the nitrogen content was on an average 68 kg N ha-1 in 0-90 cm in early ploughed soil and 39 kg N ha-1 when ploughing was delayed to spring. Also nitrate leaching was greater in treatments with early than with late tillage. This was probably because of increased nitrogen mineralization. However, when tillage was delayed there was also a substantial growth of weeds and volunteer plants during autumn, particularly couch-grass (Elymus repens L.). This caused grain yield to decrease by up to 40\% when tillage operations were delayed until late autumn or spring. Delaying tillage operations to late autumn or spring seems to be necessary to reduce the risk of nitrogen leaching. Swedish regulations for farmers to control nitrogen losses have been changed as a consequence of these results.},

  abstract = {A five-year field study was conducted in order to identify and test plant species suitable as undersown nitrogen (N) catch crops. With the aim of maximizing the catch crop effect against N leaching loss, the main focus was on identifying species with deeper rooting than ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), which is typically used for this purpose. More than 20 species from 9 plant families were studied as undersown catch crops in spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). The root and shoot biomass production, N uptake, carbon (C) to N ratio, root distribution, rooting depth, and reduction of soil nitrate-N (NO3-N) were measured, and observations of general performance as undersown catch crops were made. During barley growth only small differences in root growth among the catch crops was observed. Later, during autumn, striking differences in root growth appeared, and while ryegrass had few roots below 0.8 m (31.5 in) depth, a number of species showed high root intensities in the soil layer from 0.8 to 1.6 m (31.5 to 63.0 in). Dyer's woad (Isatis tinctoria L.) and viper's bugloss (Echium vulgare L.) showed high root intensities even at 1.6 to 2.4 m (63.0 to 94.5 in). The measured differences in root growth were significantly related to the ability of the different species to deplete soil NO3-N from deeper soil layers. Dyer's woad, which was the most efficient, reduced soil NO3-N content in November to 15 kg N ha-1 (13 lb N ac-1) in the 0 to 2.5 m (0 to 98.4 in) soil layer compared to 53 kg N ha-1 (47 lb N ac-1) under ryegrass and 62 kg N ha-1 (55 lb N ac-1) without a catch crop, and most of this difference occurred below 1 m (39.4 in) depth. There were many other differences among the species in terms of growth, N uptake, root/shoot ratio, and C/N ratio-differences that may be of interest for their use as catch crops for N management. One major effect was that legumes took up far more N than the other species and also produced more biomass than most others. However, none of the four legumes were among the deep-rooted species identified; they were among the shallowest rooted species with a root distribution close to that of ryegrass.},

  abstract = {There are concerns about whether accelerating worldwide loss of biodiversity will adversely affect ecosystem functioning and services such as forage production. Theoretically, the loss of some species or functional groups might be compensated for by changes in abundance of other species or functional groups such that ecosystem processes are unaffected. A simulation model was constructed for carbon and nitrogen transfers among plants and functional groups of microbes and soil fauna. The model was based on extensive information from shortgrass prairie, and employed stabilizing features such as prey refuges and predator switching in the trophic equations. Model parameters were derived either from the literature or were estimated to achieve a good fit between model predictions and data. The model correctly represented (i) the major effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and plant species on root and shoot biomass, residue pools, microbial biomass and soil inorganic nitrogen, and (ii) the effects on plant growth of manipulating the composition of the microbial and faunal community. The model was evaluated by comparing predictions to data not used in model development. The 15 functional groups of microbes and soil fauna were deleted one at a time and the model was run to steady state. Only six of the 15 deletions led to as much as a 15\% change in abundance of a remaining group, and only two deletions (bacteria and saprophytic fungi) led to extinctions of other groups. Functional groups with greater effect on abundance of other groups were those with greater biomass or greater number of consumers, regardless of trophic position. Of the six deletions affecting the abundance of other groups, only three (bacteria, saprophytic fungi, and root-feeding nematodes) caused as much as 10\% changes in indices of ecosystem function (nitrogen mineralization and primary production). While the soil fauna as a whole were important for maintenance of plant production, no single faunal group had a significant effect. These results suggest that ecosystems could sustain the loss of some functional groups with little decline in ecosystem services, because of compensatory changes in the abundance of surviving groups. However, this prediction probably depends on the nature of stabilizing mechanisms in the system, and these mechanisms are not fully understood.},

In comparison with the highest values of colony forming units (CFU) obtained on mesophilic media, considerably higher fungal CFU per litre of water were detected on low awmedia, ranging from 1000 to 3000 1-1in seawater, 6000 to 7000 1-1in melted sea ice and up to 13,000 1-1in melted glacier ice. The dominant taxa were ascomycetous and basidiomycetous yeasts, melanized fungi, mainly represented by the genera Cladosporium and Aureobasidium plus different species of the genus Penicillium. Preliminary taxonomic analyses revealed several new species and varieties.

The measured differences in root growth were significantly related to the ability of the different species to deplete soil NO3-N from deeper soil layers. Dyer's woad, which was the most efficient, reduced soil NO3-N content in November to 15 kg N ha-1 (13 lb N ac-1) in the 0 to 2.5 m (0 to 98.4 in) soil layer compared to 53 kg N ha-1 (47 lb N ac-1) under ryegrass and 62 kg N ha-1 (55 lb N ac-1) without a catch crop, and most of this difference occurred below 1 m (39.4 in) depth. There were many other differences among the species in terms of growth, N uptake, root/shoot ratio, and C/N ratio-differences that may be of interest for their use as catch crops for N management. One major effect was that legumes took up far more N than the other species and also produced more biomass than most others. However, none of the four legumes were among the deep-rooted species identified; they were among the shallowest rooted species with a root distribution close to that of ryegrass.},

  volume = {66},

  abstract = {The results from 14 field trials comparing the long-term ( 20 to 120 years) effects of fertilisers and manures ( farmyard manure, slurry, and green manure) on crop production and soil properties are reviewed. In total there were 24 paired comparisons of the effects of manure and fertiliser. Some of the trials also contained a control ( no nutrient inputs) treatment. The input of nutrients as either fertilisers or manures had very large effects (150-1000\%) on soil productivity as measured by crop yields. Manured soils had higher contents of organic matter and numbers of microfauna than fertilised soils, and were more enriched in P, K, Ca and Mg in topsoils and nitrate N, Ca and Mg in subsoils. Manured soils also had lower bulk density and higher porosity, hydraulic conductivity and aggregate stability, relative to fertilised soils. However, there was no significant difference (P  0.05) between fertilisers and manures in their long-term effects on crop production. In the context of this set of international trials, the recent evidence from the Rothamsted classical long-term trials appears to be exceptional, due to the larger inputs of manures and larger accumulation of soil OM in these trials. It is suggested therefore that manures may only have a benefit on soil productivity, over and above their nutrient content, when large inputs are applied over many years. The evidence from these trials also shows that, because the ratio of nutrients in manures is different from the ratio of nutrients removed by common crops, excessive accumulation of some nutrients, and particularly P and N, can arise from the long-term use of manures, relative to the use of fertilisers. Under these conditions greater runoff of P, and leaching of N may result, and for soils with low P retention and/or in situations where organic P is leached, greater P leaching losses may occur. The use of manures, relative to fertilisers, may also contribute to poor water quality by increasing its chemical oxygen demand. It is concluded therefore that it cannot generally be assumed that the long-term use of manures will enhance soil quality - defined in terms of productivity and potential to adversely affect water quality - in the long term, relative to applying the same amounts of nutrients as fertiliser.},

Thus, plants were thought to use N that microbes ``left over,'' allowing the N cycle to be divided cleanly into two pieces\textemdash{}the microbial decomposition side and the plant uptake and use side. These were linked by the process of net mineral- ization. Over the last decade, research has changed these views. N cycling is now seen as being driven by the depolymerization of N-containing polymers by microbial (including mycorrhizal) extracellular enzymes. This releases organic N-containing monomers that may be used by either plants or microbes. However, a complete new conceptual model of the soil N cycle needs to incorporate recent research on plant\textendash{}microbe competition and mi- crosite processes to explain the dynamics of N across the wide range of N availability found in terrestrial ecosystems.We discuss the evolution of thinking about the soil N cycle, propose a new integrated conceptual model that explains how N cycling changes as eco- system N availability changes, and discuss methodological issues raised by the changing paradigm of terrestrial N cycling.

  abstract = {Supergenes are tight clusters of loci that facilitate the co-segregation of adaptive variation, providing integrated control of complex adaptive phenotypes. Polymorphic supergenes, in which specific combinations of traits are maintained within a single population, were first described for 'pin' and 'thrum' floral types in Primula and Fagopyrum, but classic examples are also found in insect mimicry and snail morphology. Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that generate these co-adapted gene sets, as well as the mode of limiting the production of unfit recombinant forms, remains a substantial challenge. Here we show that individual wing-pattern morphs in the polymorphic mimetic butterfly Heliconius numata are associated with different genomic rearrangements at the supergene locus P. These rearrangements tighten the genetic linkage between at least two colour-pattern loci that are known to recombine in closely related species, with complete suppression of recombination being observed in experimental crosses across a 400-kilobase interval containing at least 18 genes. In natural populations, notable patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) are observed across the entire P region. The resulting divergent haplotype clades and inversion breakpoints are found in complete association with wing-pattern morphs. Our results indicate that allelic combinations at known wing-patterning loci have become locked together in a polymorphic rearrangement at the P locus, forming a supergene that acts as a simple switch between complex adaptive phenotypes found in sympatry. These findings highlight how genomic rearrangements can have a central role in the coexistence of adaptive phenotypes involving several genes acting in concert, by locally limiting recombination and gene flow.},

Here, we examined the impact of thawing on nitrous oxide production in permafrost cores collected from a heath site and a wetland site in Zackenberg, Greenland. Rates of nitrous oxide production in the heath soil were minimal, regardless of the hydrological conditions. Although rates of nitrous oxide production in the wetland soil were low following thawing, averaging 1.37 {$\mu$}g N h-1 kg-1, they were 18 {$\mu$}g N h-1 kg-1 for permafrost samples following thawing, drainage and rewetting with the original meltwater. We show that 31\% of the nitrous oxide produced after thawing and rewetting a 10-cm permafrost core\textemdash{}equivalent to 34 mg N m-2 d-1\textemdash{}was released to the atmosphere; this is equivalent to daily nitrous oxide emissions from tropical forests on a mean annual basis.

  abstract = {cornerstone of the theory of evolution by gradual change is that the rate of A evolution is absolutely limited by the amount of genetic variation in the evolv-ing population. FISHER'S " Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection " (1930) is a mathematical statement of this generalization, but even without mathematics it is clear that genetic change caused by natural selection presupposes genetic differences already existing, on which natural selection can operate. In a sense, a description of the genetic variation in a population is the fundamental datum of evolutionary studies; and it is necessary to explain the origin and maintenance of this variation and to predict its evolutionary consequences. It is not surprising, then, that a major effort of genetics in the last 50 years has been to characterize the amounts and kinds of genetic variation existing in natural or laboratory populations of various organisms. The results so far have told us a great deal about cytological variation such as polymorphisms for inversions and translocations, about frequencies of rare visible mutations at many loci, and about frequencies of chromosomes that are deleterious when homozygous together with the degree of that deleterious effect. In addition, we know of some striking singlelocus polymorphisms. These results are familiar to all students of population genetics and evolution, and have been well reviewed by DOBZHANSKY (195 1) and more recently by MAYR (1 963). Yet, for all the wealth of observation and experiment, the techniques of popu-lation genetics have not allowed us to ask directly the most elementary question about the genetic structure of a population: At w h t proportion of his loci can we expect a diploid individual to be heterozygous? Put in another way, this is the question of how much genetic variation there is in any given population. That this question remains unanswered is best shown by a statement of MAYR (1963) at the end of more than 100 pages of review of our present knowledge. " It has been estimated (WALLACE 1958) that 50 percent or more of the loci of a given indi-vidual in an open, natural population may be occupied by dissimilar alleles. Others calculate that I S 2 0 variable loci already place a severe strain on a population, owing to the segregation of inferior genotypes. Far more research and a classification of the basic concepts is needed to narrow the gap between these widely diverging estimates.

For the determination of total N, samples were oxidised with K2S2O8 at 110 ??C in a 96 ?? 1.1 mL polytetrafluoroethylene block with a lid that closed individual wells. The oxidised solutions were transferred to standard plates for colourimetric analysis of NO3-. The recovery of N, measured as NO3-, from NH4NO3 and a range of organic-N compounds was 95\%. The limits of quantitation of the colourimetic assays were 0.020 mg N L-1 for NO3- and 0.051 mg N L-1 for NH4+. The methods were tested on water extracts derived from a range of 10 nutrient poor soils from Scotland. There were acceptable linear correlations between the results obtained by established methods. For soil extracts analysed by the microplate method, the relationship for NO3- was 1.03?? result from ion chromatography + 0.0055 (R2 = 0.9961); for NH4+ determined by the microplate method, the relationship was 0.9696 ?? result from a discrete analyser - 0.0169 (R2 = 0.9757) and for total N determined by oxidation in the PTFE microplate the relationship was 0.9435 ?? result obtained by combustion + 0.0489 (R2 = 0.9743).

We evaluated soil hydrologic controls on N2O emissions during experimental water table fluctuations in large, intact soil columns amended with 100 kg ha-1 - KNO3-N. Soil columns were collected from three landscape positions that vary in hydrological and biogeochemical properties (N512 columns).We flooded columns from bottom to surface to simulate water table fluctuations that are typical for this site, and expected to increase given future climate change scenarios. After the soil was saturated to the surface, we allowed the columns to drain freely while monitoring volumetric soil water content, matric potential and N2O emissions over 96 h. Across all landscape positions and replicate soil columns, there was a positive linear relationship between total soil N and the log of cumulative N2O emissions (r250.47; P50.013). Within individual soil columns, N2O flux was a Gaussian function of water-filled pore space (WFPS) during drainage (mean r250.90). However, instantaneous maximum N2O flux rates did not occur at a consistent WFPS, ranging from 63\% to 98\% WFPS across landscape positions and replicate soil columns. In contrast, instantaneous maximumN2Oflux rates occurred within a narrow range (-1.88 to -4.48 kPa) of soil matric potential that approximated field capacity. The relatively consistent relationship between maximum N2O flux rates and matric potential indicates that water filled pore size is an important factor affecting soil N2O fluxes. These data demonstrate that matric potential is the strongest predictor of the timing of N2O fluxes across soils that differ in texture, structure and bulk density.},

Previous phenotypic analyses of latitudinal clines have investigated mainly physiological, morphological, or life-history traits. Here, we studied latitudinal variation in sleep in D. melanogaster populations from North and Central America. In parallel, we used RNA-seq to identify interpopulation gene expression differences.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nRESULTS: We found that in D. melanogaster the average nighttime sleep bout duration exhibits a latitudinal cline such that sleep bouts of equatorial populations are roughly twice as long as those of temperate populations. Interestingly, this pattern of latitudinal variation is not observed for any daytime measure of activity or sleep. We also found evidence for geographic variation for sunrise anticipation. Our RNA-seq experiment carried out on heads from a low and high latitude population identified a large number of gene expression differences, most of which were time dependent. Differentially expressed genes were enriched in circadian regulated genes and enriched in genes potentially under spatially varying selection.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSION: Our results are consistent with a mechanistic and selective decoupling of nighttime and daytime activity. Furthermore, the present study suggests that natural selection plays a major role in generating transcriptomic variation associated with circadian behaviors. Finally, we identified genomic variants plausibly causally associated with the observed behavioral and transcriptomic variation.},

  abstract = {An adaptationist programme has dominated evolutionary thought in England and the United States during the past 40 years. It is based on faith in the power of natural selection as an optimizing agent. It proceeds by breaking an oragnism into unitary 'traits' and proposing an adaptive story for each considered separately. Trade-offs among competing selective demands exert the only brake upon perfection; non-optimality is thereby rendered as a result of adaptation as well. We criticize this approach and attempt to reassert a competing notion (long popular in continental Europe) that organisms must be analysed as integrated wholes, with Baupl{\"a}ne so constrained by phyletic heritage, pathways of development and general architecture that the constraints themselves become more interesting and more important in delimiting pathways of change than the selective force that may mediate change when it occurs. We fault the adaptationist programme for its failure to distinguish current utility from reasons for origin (male tyrannosaurs may have used their diminutive front legs to titillate female partners, but this will not explain why they got so small); for its unwillingness to consider alternatives to adaptive stories; for its reliance upon plausibility alone as a criterion for accepting speculative tales; and for its failure to consider adequately such competing themes as random fixation of alleles, production of non-adaptive structures by developmental correlation with selected features (allometry, pleiotropy, material compensation, mechanically forced correlation), the separability of adaptation and selection, multiple adaptive peaks, and current utility as an epiphenomenon of non-adaptive structures. We support Darwin's own pluralistic approach to identifying the agents of evolutionary change.},

  abstract = {Here we provide evidence that the form of carbon compound and O2 concentration exert an inter-related regulation on the production and reduction of N2O in soil. 6.7 mM d-glucose, 6.7 mM D-mannitol, 8 mM L-glutamic acid or 10 mM butyrate (all equivalent to 0.48 g C l-1) were applied to slurries of a sandy loam soil. At the start of the experiment headspace O2 concentrations were established at ???2\%, 10\% and 21\% O2 v/v for each C treatment, and 2 mM K15NO3 (25 atom \% excess 15N) was applied, enabling quantification of 15N-N2 production, 15N-(N2O-to-N2) ratios and DNRA. The form of C compound was most important in the initially oxic (21\% O2 v/v) soils, where addition of butyrate and glutamic acid resulted in greater N2O production (0.61 and 0.3 ??g N2O-N g-1 soil for butyrate and glutamic acid, respectively) than the addition of carbohydrates (glucose and mannitol). Although, there was no significant effect of C compound at low initial O2 concentrations (???2\% O2 v/v), production of 15N-N2 was greatest where headspace O2 concentrations were initially, or fallen to, ???2\% O2 v/v, with greatest reduction of N2O and lowering 15N-(N2O-to-N2) ratios (???0-0.27). This may reflect that the effect of C is indirect through stimulation of heterotrophic respiration, lowering O2 concentrations, providing sub-oxic conditions for dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways. Addition of carbohydrates (glucose and mannitol) also resulted in greatest recovery of 15N in NH4 + from applied 15N-NO3 -, indicative of the occurrence of DNRA, even in the slurries with initial 10\% and 21\% O2 v/v concentrations. Our 15N approach has provided the first direct evidence for enhancement of N2O reduction in the presence of carbohydrates and the dual regulation of C compound and O2 concentration on N2O production and reduction, which has implications for management of N2O emissions through changing C inputs (exudates, rhizodeposition, residues) with plant species of differing C traits, or through plant breeding. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {In agricultural systems, optimization of carbon and nitrogen cycling through soil organic matter can improve soil fertility and yields while reducing negative environmental impact. A basic tenet that has guided the management of soil organic matter for decades has been that equilibrium levels of carbon and nitrogen are controlled by their net input and that qualitative differences in these inputs are relatively unimportant. This contrasts with natural ecosystems in which there are significant effects of species composition and litter quality on carbon and nitrogen cycling. Here we report the net balances of carbon and nitrogen from a 15-year study in which three distinct maize/ soybean agroecosystems are compared. Quantitative differences in net primary productivity and nitrogen balance across agroecosystems do not account for the observed changes in soil carbon and nitrogen. We suggest that the use of low carbon-to-nitrogen organic residues to maintain soil fertility, combined with greater temporal diversity in cropping sequences, significantly increases the retention of soil carbon and nitrogen, which has important implications for regional and global carbon and nitrogen budgets, sustained production, and environmental quality.},

  abstract = {The transport mechanisms of As from contaminated soil or irrigation water into roots and subsequently into grain, and the As species distribution-a toxicity determinant, is critical for assessing health risks imposed by As. However, the commonly-employed extraction of plant material with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) has not proven successful in preserving inorganic As species. Synchrotron-based spectroscopic techniques are useful for discerning elemental distributions and chemical speciation of elements in situ. Here, we both characterize the mineral phases of Fe coatings on rice roots, and quantify plant nutrients and As species in situ on roots and grain samples. Arsenic in rice grains was present in bran layers as oxidized As (69-88\% as As(V)i and 12-31\% as DMA) and in the germ as a mixture of As(V)i and As(III)i, but was non-detected from the endosperm, which is consistent with previous findings. The extent of Fe coatings on rice roots was variable and, when present, consisted of lepidocrocite (??-FeOOH), goethite (??-FeOOH) and ferrihydrite (Fe(OH)3??nH2O). Arsenic was co-located with root Fe coatings, but our findings indicate that Fe is not a direct interceptor of As uptake, and is rather a bulk scavenger mostly near the air-water interface. On whole root mounts with Fe plaque, arsenic was present as mixed species of As(V)i (44-66\%) and As(III)i (34-56\%). Within a root cross-section, oxidized As species were dominant in the xylem (86\% as As(V)i and 14\% as DMA) whereas mostly reduced species (71\% as As(III)i, 29\% as AsGlu3) resided within a vacuole adjacent to the xylem. This finding contrasts the prevailing view that As(V)i is rapidly reduced in roots and transported to shoots as As(III)i, and points to the importance of interspecies differences in As-uptake dynamics. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here we show that a shift in colour pattern mimicry was crucial in the origin of two butterfly species. The sister species Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius cydno recently diverged to mimic different model taxa, and our experiments show that their mimetic coloration is also important in choosing mates. Assortative mating between the sister species means that hybridization is rare in nature, and the few hybrids that are produced are non-mimetic, poorly adapted intermediates. Thus, the mimetic shift has caused both pre-mating and post-mating isolation. In addition, individuals from a population of H. melpomene allopatric to H. cydno court and mate with H. cydno more readily than those from a sympatric population. This suggests that assortative mating has been enhanced in sympatry.},

To overcome this problem, a dual isotope method using both 15N and 18O was proposed. However, O exchange between nitrogen oxides and water has been found to disturb such a method. We here explain in detail a novel dual isotope method that allows to quantify O exchange in denitrification and to differentiate N2O production from NN, ND, NCD, and fertilizer denitrification (FD). The method has already been applied to a range of soils with good success. Potential of and scope for further improvement of the method are discussed. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

When it comes to microorganisms, however, under-standing the role of natural selection in producing adaptive solutions has historically been, and sometimes continues to be, contentious. This tension is curious because microbes enable one to observe the power of adaptation by natural selection with exceptional rigor and clarity, as exemplified by the burgeoning field of experimental microbial evolution.

  abstract = {There have been few comparisons of the performance of no-tillage cropping systems vs. organic farming systems, particularly on erodible, droughty soils where reduced-tillage systems are recommended. In particular, there is skepticism whether organic farming can improve soils as well as conventional no-tillage systems because of the requirement for tillage associated with many organic farming operations. A 9-yr comparison of selected minimum-tillage strategies for grain production of corn (Zea mays L.), soybean Glycine max (L.) Merr., and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was conducted on a sloping, droughty site in Beltsville, MD, from 1994 to 2002. Four systems were compared: (i) a standard mid-Atlantic no-tillage system (NT) with recommended herbicide and N inputs, (ii) a cover crop-based no-tillage system (CC) including hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) before corn, and rye (Secale cereale L.) before soybean, with reduced herbicide and N inputs, (iii) a no-tillage crownvetch (Coronilla varia L.) living mulch system (CV) with recommended herbicide and N inputs, and (iv) a chisel-plow based organic system (OR) with cover crops and manure for nutrients and postplanting cultivation for weed control. After 9 yr, competition with corn by weeds in OR and by the crownvetch living mulch in CV was unacceptable, particularly in dry years. On average, corn yields were 28 and 12\% lower in OR and CV, respectively, than in the standard NT, whereas corn yields in CC and NT were similar. Despite the use of tillage, soil combustible C and N concentrations were higher at all depth intervals to 30 cm in OR compared with that in all other systems. A uniformity trial was conducted from 2003 to 2005 with corn grown according to the NT system on all plots. Yield of corn grown on plots with a 9-yr history of OR and CV were 18 and 19\% higher, respectively, than those with a history of NT whereas there was no difference between corn yield of plots with a history of NT and CC. Three tests of N availability (corn yield loss in subplots with no N applied in 2003-2005, presidedress soil nitrate test, and corn ear leaf N) all confirmed that there was more N available to corn in OR and CV than in NT. These results suggest that OR can provide greater long-term soil benefits than conventional NT, despite the use of tillage in OR. However, these benefits may not be realized because of difficulty controlling weeds in OR.},

  abstract = {Land use change is a significant threat to biodiversity, particularly within tropical ecosystems, but the responses of microbial communities remain poorly understood. We used long-term plots established in multiple land use types in the Brazilian Amazon to examine the effect of land use change on soil fungal communities. We measured fungal richness and composition and identified factors associated with shifts in community composition across multiple land use types, including primary forest, two secondary forests and a chronosequence of differently aged pastures. Additionally, we used distribution patterns to estimate the niche breadth of fungal taxa in order to quantify changes in the relative abundance of generalists, or fungi with broad environmental tolerance, in response to land use change. Conversion of primary forest to pasture resulted in large reductions in fungal richness coupled with substantial changes in community composition. Generalist fungi were strongly favoured in all pasture sites, regardless of time since conversion. Distance to primary forests was the strongest correlate of community composition in pastures, indicating that primary forests can act as reservoirs for recolonization by forest-associated fungi. The two secondary forests showed variable patterns of richness, composition and the overall abundance of generalist fungi, suggesting that community recovery is stochastic. Fungal community response to land use change mirrors patterns observed in macroscopic organisms, which indicates that the increased prevalence of generalist taxa is a consistent response to disturbance across broad taxonomic groups. \textcopyright{} 2016 British Ecological Society.},

Typically, ??-irradiation at 10kGy will eliminate actinomycetes, fungi and invertebrates in most soils. The majority of soil bacteria are eliminated by 20 kGy, however, a dose higher than 70 kGy may be required to kill certain radio-resistant bacteria. We recommend prior to experimentation that the radiosensitivity of soils are determined so as to ensure the desired chemical and biological effects are achieved. ??-Irradiation may not be an appropriate method for all experiments as it can influence soil chemical properties, in particular soil nitrate and ammonium levels.

Here, we address a fundamental and unanswered question in microbial ecology: 'When do we need to understand microbial community structure to accurately predict function?' We present a statistical analysis investigating the value of environmental data and microbial community structure independently and in combination for explaining rates of carbon and nitrogen cycling processes within 82 global datasets. Environmental variables were the strongest predictors of process rates but left 44\% of variation unexplained on average, suggesting the potential for microbial data to increase model accuracy. Although only 29\% of our datasets were significantly improved by adding information on microbial community structure, we observed improvement in models of processes mediated by narrow phylogenetic guilds via functional gene data, and conversely, improvement in models of facultative microbial processes via community diversity metrics. Our results also suggest that microbial diversity can strengthen predictions of respiration rates beyond microbial biomass parameters, as 53\% of models were improved by incorporating both sets of predictors compared to 35\% by microbial biomass alone. Our analysis represents the first comprehensive analysis of research examining links between microbial community structure and ecosystem function. Taken together, our results indicate that a greater understanding of microbial communities informed by ecological principles may enhance our ability to predict ecosystem process rates relative to assessments based on environmental variables and microbial physiology.},

  abstract = {All over the world, glaciers are receding. One key conse- quence of glacier area loss is the creation of new terres- trial habitats. This presents an experimental opportunity to study both community formation and the implications of glacier loss for terrestrial ecosystems. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Rime et al. (2015) describe how micro- bial communities are structured according to soil depth and development in the forefield of Damma glacier in Switzerland. The study provides insights into the con- trasting structures of microbial communities at different stages of soil development. An important strength of the study is the integration of soil depth into the paradigm of primary succession, a feature which has rarely been considered by other studies. These findings underscore the importance of studying the interactions between microbial communities and glaciers at a time when Earth's glacial systems are experiencing profound change.},

  abstract = {The Amazon rainforest is the Earth's largest reservoir of plant and animal diversity, and it has been subjected to especially high rates of land use change, primarily to cattle pasture. This conversion has had a strongly negative effect on biological diversity, reducing the number of plant and animal species and homogenizing communities. We report here that microbial biodiversity also responds strongly to conversion of the Amazon rainforest, but in a manner different from plants and animals. Local taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of soil bacteria increases after conversion, but communities become more similar across space. This homogenization is driven by the loss of forest soil bacteria with restricted ranges (endemics) and results in a net loss of diversity. This study shows homogenization of microbial communities in response to human activities. Given that soil microbes represent the majority of biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems and are intimately involved in ecosystem functions, we argue that microbial biodiversity loss should be taken into account when assessing the impact of land use change in tropical forests.},

While the carbon (C) cycle response to such perturbations has received considerable attention, potential responses of the soil nitrogen (N) cycle to changing organic matter inputs have been less well characterized. Changing litter inputs to surface to soils may alter the soil N cycle directly, by controlling N substrate availability, or indirectly, via interactions with soil C biogeochemistry. We investigated soil N-cycling responses to a leaf litter manipulation in a lowland tropical forest using isotopic and molecular techniques. Both removing and doubling leaf litter inputs decreased the size of the soil nitrate pool, gross nitrification rates, and the relative abundance of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms. Gross nitrification rates were correlated with the relative abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea, and shifts in the N-cycling microbial community composition correlated with concurrent changes in edaphic properties, notably pH and C:N ratios. These results highlight the importance of understanding coupled biogeochemical cycles in global change scenarios and suggest that environmental perturbations that alter organic matter inputs in tropical forests could reduce inorganic N losses to surface waters and the atmosphere by limiting nitrate production.},

  abstract = {The production of nonmethane volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by soil microbes is likely to have an important influence on soil ecology and terrestrial biogeochemistry. However, soil VOC production has received relatively little attention, and we do not know how the emissions of microbially-produced VOCs vary across soil and litter types. We collected 40 root-free soil and litter samples from a diverse array of ecosystem types and conducted laboratory incubations in order to compare the types and quantities of VOCs emitted. VOC production rates were higher in litter samples than in soil samples, and the rates were correlated with microbial biomass and CO2 production levels. On average, the litter samples produced more types of VOCs than the soil samples with litters emitting a number of VOCs (including terpenoids) that were not generally emitted from the soil samples. Across all of the samples, we identified 100 VOCs, and more than 70\% of these compounds could not be positively identified by GC/MS analyses. Of those VOCs that could be identified, furfural and similar furan compounds were noteworthy in that they were emitted in large amounts from nearly every sample examined. Other identifiable VOCs produced across a range of soil and litter samples included propanoic and butanoic acids, which are known products of microbial fermentation. Together these results suggest a need for additional research examining the specific factors influencing VOC emissions from soil and the identification of specific VOCs emitted from soil and litter as many of these compounds are likely to have important effects on belowground ecology. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  issn = {01671987},
  abstract = {This paper seeks to review the current knowledge on soil cultivation and its effects to both soil physical properties and consideration to soil management to optimise crop productivity and yield when using non-inversion tillage within the United Kingdom (UK). There are many terms used to describe conservation tillage, more commonly referred to within the UK as non-inversion tillage, but it has generally been defined as any tillage system that maintains at least 30\% residue cover on the soil surface after drilling to reduce the risk of soil erosion, conserve soil organic matter and improve soil structural stability.Consideration to a number of important factors needs to be given if successful adoption of non-inversion tillage is to be made in the UK. Soil type can have a substantial influence on the relative success of the adoption of non-inversion tillage. For example, on self-structuring clay soils the system can be relatively well suited and allow for timely cultivations that reduces the risk for creating very dry, cloddy seedbeds following ploughing wet soil that are difficult for establishing a successful crop. However, in contrast some unstructured light sand soils tend not to be suitable for non-inversion tillage because the soil aggregates tend to form an angular structure that fit tightly together excluding the movement of air and water through the soil profile that are fundamental requirements for healthy crop growth. Further agronomic management factors including crop residue handling at harvest and the consideration to weed control strategies that seek to reduce the risk to increasing herbicide resistance, in particular grass weeds, from the use of selective herbicide groups, e.g. sulfonylurea herbicides (e.g. Atlantis). If these factors are carefully managed then the opportunities in reducing fuel use, timeliness of cultivations and improved soil erosion control that non-inversion tillage can offer are potentially of great value in adopting sustainable cultivation strategies for maintaining or improving crop performance in a period of increased economic and environmental uncertainty. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Soil microorganisms found in the root zone impact plant growth and development, but the potential to harness these benefits is hampered by the sheer abundance and diversity of the players influencing desirable plant traits. Here, we report a high level of reproducibility of soil microbiomes in altering plant flowering time and soil functions when partnered within and between plant hosts. We used a multi-generation experimental system using Arabidopsis thaliana Col to select for soil microbiomes inducing earlier or later flowering times of their hosts. We then inoculated the selected microbiomes from the tenth generation of plantings into the soils of three additional A. thaliana genotypes (Ler, Be, RLD) and a related crucifer (Brassica rapa). With the exception of Ler, all other plant hosts showed a shift in flowering time corresponding with the inoculation of early-or late-flowering microbiomes. Analysis of the soil microbial community using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing showed distinct microbiota profiles assembling by flowering time treatment. Plant hosts grown with the late-flowering-associated microbiomes showed consequent increases in inflorescence biomass for three A. thaliana genotypes and an increase in total biomass for B. rapa. The increase in biomass was correlated with two-to five-fold enhancement of microbial extracellular enzyme activities associated with nitrogen mineralization in soils. The reproducibility of the flowering phenotype across plant hosts suggests that microbiomes can be selected to modify plant traits and coordinate changes in soil resource pools.},

  volume = {17},
  issn = {13541013},
  abstract = {The response of soil organic matter (OM) decomposition to increasing temperature is a critical aspect of ecosystem responses to global change. The impacts of climate warming on decomposition dynamics have not been resolved due to apparently contradictory results from field and lab experiments, most of which has focused on labile carbon with short turnover times. But the majority of total soil carbon stocks are comprised of organic carbon with turnover times of decades to centuries. Understanding the response of these carbon pools to climate change is essential for forecasting longer-term changes in soil carbon storage. Herein, we briefly synthesize information from recent studies that have been conducted using a wide variety of approaches. In our effort to understand research to-date, we derive a new conceptual model that explicitly identifies the processes controlling soil OM availability for decomposition and allows a more explicit description of the factors regulating OM decomposition under different circumstances. It explicitly defines resistance of soil OM to decomposition as being due either to its chemical conformation (quality) or its physico-chemical protection from decomposition. The former is embodied in the depolymerization process, the latter by adsorption/desorption and aggregate turnover. We hypothesize a strong role for variation in temperature sensitivity as a function of reaction rates for both. We conclude that important advances in understanding the temperature response of the processes that control substrate availability, depolymerization, microbial efficiency, and enzyme production will be needed to predict the fate of soil carbon stocks in a warmer world.},

  volume = {9},
  issn = {17571707},
  abstract = {Future liquid fuel demand from renewable sources may, in part, be met by converting the seasonally wet portions of the landscape currently managed for soil and water conservation to perennial energy crops. However, this shift may increase nitrous oxide (Nsub2/subO) emissions, thus limiting the carbon (C) benefits of energy crops. Particularly high emissions may occur during the transition period when the soil is disturbed, plants are establishing, and nitrate and water accumulation may favor emissions. We measured Nsub2/subO emissions and associated environmental drivers during the transition of perennial grassland in a Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and Miscanthus x giganteus in the bottom 3-ha of a watershed in the Ridge and Valley ecoregion of the northeastern United States. Replicated treatments of CRP (unconverted), unfertilized switchgrass (switchgrass), nitrogen (N) fertilized switchgrass (switchgrass-N), and Miscanthus were randomized in four blocks. Each plot was divided into shoulder, backslope, and footslope positions based on the slope and moisture gradient. Soil Nsub2/subO flux, soil moisture, and soil mineral nitrogen availability were monitored during the growing season of 2013, the year after the land conversion. Growing season Nsub2/subO flux showed a significant vegetation-by-landscape position interaction (P0.009). Switchgrass-N and Miscanthus treatments had 3 and 6-times higher cumulative flux respectively than the CRP in the footslope, but at other landscape positions fluxes were similar among land uses. A peak Nsub2/subO emission event, contributing 26\% of the cumulative flux, occurred after a 10.8-cm of rain during early June. Prolonged subsoil saturation coinciding with high mineral N concentration fueled Nsub2/subO emission hot spots in the footslopes under energy crops. Our results suggest that mitigating Nsub2/subO emissions during the transition of CRP to energy crops would mostly require a site-specific management of the footslopes.},

  abstract = {Conventional agriculture has improved in crop yield but at large costs to the environment, particularly off-site pollution from mineral N fertilizers. In response to environmental concerns, organic agriculture has become an increasingly popular option. One component of organic agriculture that remains in question is whether it can reduce agricultural N losses to groundwater and the atmosphere relative to conventional agriculture. Here we report reduced N pollution from organic and integrated farming systems compared with a conventional farming system. We evaluated differences in denitrification potential and a suite of other soil biological and chemical properties in soil samples taken from organic, integrated, and conventional treatments in an experimental apple orchard. Organically farmed soils exhibited higher potential denitrification rates, greater denitrification efficiency, higher organic matter, and greater microbial activity than conventionally farmed soils. The observed differences in denitrifier function were then assessed under field conditions after fertilization. N(2)O emissions were not significantly different among treatments; however, N(2) emissions were highest in organic plots. Annual nitrate leaching was 4.4-5.6 times higher in conventional plots than in organic plots, with the integrated plots in between. This study demonstrates that organic and integrated fertilization practices support more active and efficient denitrifier communities, shift the balance of N(2) emissions and nitrate losses, and reduce environmentally damaging nitrate losses. Although this study specifically examines a perennial orchard system, the ecological and biogeochemical processes we evaluated are present in all agroecosystems, and the reductions in nitrate loss in this study could also be achievable in other cropping systems.},

  abstract = {Sporadic observations from pure culture study and direct soil measurement have indicated that fungi can substantially contribute to soil N2O production. Yet, it is still uncertain whether this fungal significance is a more general ecological phenomenon. In this study, relative contributions of fungi and bacteria to soil N2O production were examined in five ecosystems, including conventional farming (CON), integrated crop and livestock system (ICL), organic farming (ORG), plantation forestry (PF), and abandoned agriculture field subjected to natural succession (SUCC). Soil N2O production was measured at 90\% water-filled pore space from antibiotic-free controls and soils amended with streptomycin, cycloheximide, or both. Streptomycin and cycloheximide additions significantly reduced soil N2O fluxes from the five systems, ranging from 31\% to 54\% and 40\% to 51\%, respectively. Fungi contributed more to soil N2O fluxes than bacteria in PF, whereas fungi and bacteria made comparable contributions in other four systems. Furthermore, soil pH was correlated positively with the percentage of bacterial contribution to soil N2O flux, but negatively with the percentage of fungal contribution to soil N2O flux as well as the ratio of fungal-to-bacterial contributions. Our results showed that fungi could potentially contribute to soil N2O production in diverse agroecosystems and their contribution might be more pronounced in the acidic plantation forestry. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Given high species diversity in microbial communities and the ability of microbes to adapt rapidly to new conditions, this assumption of functional redundancy seems plausible. We test the assumption by comparing litter decomposition rates in experimental microcosms inoculated with distinct microbial communities. We find that rates of carbon dioxide production from litter decomposition were dependent upon the microbial inoculum, with differences in the microbial community alone accounting for substantial (20\%) variation in total carbon mineralized. Communities that shared a common history with a given foliar litter exhibited higher decomposition rates when compared to communities foreign to that habitat. Our results suggest that the implicit assumption in ecosystem models (i.e., microbial communities in the same environment are functionally equivalent) is incorrect. To predict accurately how biogeochemical processes will respond to global change may require consideration of the community composition and/or adaptation of microbial communities to past resource environments.},

  abstract = {1. Ecological studies identifying a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem services motivate projections that higher plant diversity will increase services from agroecosys- tems. While this idea is compelling, evidence of generalizable relationships between biodiver- sity and ecosystem services that could be broadly applied in agricultural systems is lacking. 2. Cover crops grown in rotation with cash crops are a realistic strategy to increase agroe- cosystem diversity. We evaluated the prediction that further increasing diversity with cover crop polycultures would enhance ecosystem services and multifunctionality in a 2-year study of eighteen cover crop treatments ranging in diversity from one to eight species. Five ecosys- tem services were measured in each cover crop system and regression analysis used to explore the relationship between multifunctionality and several diversity indices. 3. As expected, there was a positive relationship between species richness and multifunction- ality, but it only explained a small fraction of variance in ecosystem services (marginal R2 =0?05). In contrast, indices of functional diversity, particularly the distribution of trait abundances, were stronger predictors of multifunctionality (marginal R2 =0?15\textendash{}0?38). 4. Synthesis and application. In a corn production system, simply increasing cover crop species richness will have a small impact on agroecosystem services, but designing polycul- tures that maximize functional diversity may lead to agroecosystems with greater multifunctionality.},

  abstract = {Biological productivity in most of the world's oceans is controlled by the supply of nutrients to surface waters. The relative balance between supply and removal of nutrients--including nitrogen, iron and phosphorus--determines which nutrient limits phytoplankton growth. Although nitrogen limits productivity in much of the ocean, large portions of the tropics and subtropics are defined by extreme nitrogen depletion. In these regions, microbial denitrification removes biologically available forms of nitrogen from the water column, producing substantial deficits relative to other nutrients. Here we demonstrate that nitrogen-deficient areas of the tropical and subtropical oceans are acutely vulnerable to nitrogen pollution. Despite naturally high nutrient concentrations and productivity, nitrogen-rich agricultural runoff fuels large (54-577 km2) phytoplankton blooms in the Gulf of California. Runoff exerts a strong and consistent influence on biological processes, in 80\% of cases stimulating blooms within days of fertilization and irrigation of agricultural fields. We project that by the year 2050, 27-59\% of all nitrogen fertilizer will be applied in developing regions located upstream of nitrogen-deficient marine ecosystems. Our findings highlight the present and future vulnerability of these ecosystems to agricultural runoff.},

  abstract = {Microbial metabolism powers biogeochemical cycling in Earth's ecosystems. The taxonomic composition of microbial communities varies substantially between environments, but the ecological causes of this variation remain largely unknown. We analyzed taxonomic and functional community profiles to determine the factors that shape marine bacterial and archaeal communities across the global ocean. By classifying 30,000 marine microorganisms into metabolic functional groups, we were able to disentangle functional from taxonomic community variation. We find that environmental conditions strongly influence the distribution of functional groups in marine microbial communities by shaping metabolic niches, but only weakly influence taxonomic composition within individual functional groups. Hence, functional structure and composition within functional groups constitute complementary and roughly independent "axes of variation" shaped by markedly different processes.},

  volume = {171},
  issn = {14368730},
  abstract = {We summarize progress with respect to (1) different approaches to isolate, extract, and quantify organo-mineral compounds from soils, (2) types of mineral surfaces and associated interactions, (3) the distribution and function of soil biota. at organo-mineral surfaces, (4) the distribution and content of organo-mineral associations, and (5) the factors controlling the turnover of organic matter (OM) in organo-mineral associations from temperate soils. Physical fractionation achieves a rough separation between plant residues and m ineral-associated OM, which makes density or particle-size fractionation a useful pretreatment for further differentiation of functional fractions. A part of the OM in organo-mineral associations resists different chemical treatments, but the data obtained cannot readily be compared among each other, and more research is necessary on the processes underlying resistance to treatments for certain OM components. Studies using physical-fractionation procedures followed by soil-microbiological analyses revealed that organo-mineral associations spatially isolate C sources from soil biota, making quantity and quality of OM in microhabitats an important factor controlling community composition. The distribution and activity of soil microorganisms at organo-mineral surfaces can additionally be modified by faunal activities. Composition of OM in organo-mineral associations is highly variable, with loamy soils having generally a higher contribution of polysaccharides, whereas mineral-associated OM in sandy soils is often more aliphatic. Though highly reactive towards Fe oxide surfaces, lignin and phenolic components are usually depleted in organo-mineral associations. Charred OM associated with the mineral surface contributes to a higher aromaticity in heavy fractions. The relative proportion of OC bound in organo-mineral fractions increases with soil depth. Likewise does the strength of the bonding. Organic molecules sorbed to the mineral surfaces or precipitated by Al are effectively stabilized, indicated by reduced susceptibility towards oxidative attack, higher thermal stability, and lower bioavailability. At higher surface loading, organic C is much better bioavailable, also indicated by little C-14 age. In the subsurface horizons of the soils investigated in this study, Fe oxides seem to be the most important sorbents, whereas phyllosilicate surfaces may be comparatively more important in topsoils. Specific surface area of soil minerals is not always a good predictor for C-stabilization potentials because surface coverage is discontinuous. Recalcitrance and accessibility/aggregation seem to determine the turnover dynamics in fast and intermediate cycling OM pools, but for long-term OC preservation the interactions with mineral surfaces, and especially with Fe oxide surfaces, are a major control in all soils investigated here.},

Recent advances have revealed that both deterministic and stochastic processes operating across multiple spatial scales shape the composition of host-associated microbial communities. Although most research has focused on deterministic processes within individual hosts, the microbiota within each host is increasingly recognized to contribute to a wider metacommunity maintained by transmission between individual hosts and dispersal between host-associated and free-living microbial communities. By applying a community ecology perspective encompassing the microbial metacommunity, the many determinants of host-associated microbial community composition can be identified, guiding the directions of future research.},

We added urea ammonium nitrate or granular urea at nine levels (0\textendash{}292 kg N ha-1) to four replicate plots of continuous maize. We measured N2O fluxes and available soil N biweekly following fertilization and grain yields at the end of the growing season. From 2001 to 2003 N2O fluxes were moderately low (ca. 20 g N2O-N ha-1 day-1) at levels of N addition to 101 kg N ha-1, where grain yields were maximized, after which fluxes more than doubled (to 50 g N2O-N ha-1 day-1). This threshold N2O response to N fertilization suggests that agricultural N2O fluxes could be reduced with no or little yield penalty by reducing N fertilizer inputs to levels that just satisfy crop needs.},

But these claims ignore a large body of experimental evidence showing that the quantity of additional organic carbon in soil under no-till is relatively small: in large part apparent increases result from an altered depth distribution. The larger concentration near the surface in no-till is generally beneficial for soil properties that often, though not always, translate into improved crop growth. In many regions where no-till is practised it is common for soil to be cultivated conventionally every few years for a range of agronomic reasons, so any soil carbon benefit is then lost. We argue that no-till is beneficial for soil quality and adaptation of agriculture to climate change, but its role in mitigation is widely overstated.},

This study describes an alternative technique to directly measure soil and snowmelt solution fluxes utilizing ion exchange resin-based collectors. Resin-lysimeters were constructed by enclosing a layer of resin between two layers of nutrient-free silica sand within a PVC tube. N and P fluxes from the resin based collectors were compared against buried resin bags, ceramic cup lysimeters, and traditional snowmelt solution collectors co-located in an eastern Sierra Nevada forest. Ammonium and P accumulation in resin lysimeters was 1- to 2 orders of magnitude smaller than in buried resin bags placed in direct contact with the soil. Resin lysimeters and resin snowmelt collectors measured NH4-N and P fluxes that were 3x greater than those estimated from ceramic cup lysimeters and solution snowmelt collectors. We hypothesize that this difference was due to spoilage of the solution sample in solution collectors between collections. Resin lysimeters are easy to construct, provide a direct measurement of nutrient fluxes, and are an alternative to solution snowmelt collectors and ceramic cup lysimeters, especially in areas where poor winter accessibility precludes constant maintenance.},

  title = {Terrestrial Ecosystems and the Carbon Cycle},
  volume = {1},
  abstract = {The terrestrial biosphere plays an important role in the global carbon cycle. In the 1994 Intergovernmental Panel Assessment on Climate Change (IPCC), an effort was made to improve the quantification of terrestrial exchanges and potential feedbacks from climate, changing CO2, and other factors; this paper presents the key results from that assessment, together with expanded discussion. The carbon cycle is the fluxes of carbon among four main reservoirs: fossil carbon, the atmosphere, the oceans, and the terrestrial biosphere. Emissions of fossil carbon during the 1980s averaged 5.5 Gt y"'. During the same period, the atmosphere gained 3.2 Gt C y"\^ and the oceans are believed to have absorbed 2.0 Gt C y"'. The regrowing forests of the Northern Hemisphere may have absorbed 0.5 Gt C y"\^ during this period. Meanwhile, tropical deforestation is thought to have released an average 1.6 Gt C y"\^ over the 1980s. While the fluxes among the four pools should balance, the average 198Ds values lead to a 'missing sink' of 1.4 Gt C y"\^ Several processes, including forest regrowth, CO2 fertilization of plant growth (c. 1.0 Gt C y"*), N deposition (c. 0.6 Gt C y'\^), and their interactions, may account for the budget imbalance. However, it remains difticult to quantify the influences of these separate but interactive processes. Uncertainties in the individual numbers are large, and are themselves poorly quantified. This paper presents detail beyond the IPCC assessment on procedures used to approximate the flux uncertainties. Lack of knowledge about positive and negative feedbacks from the biosphere is a major limiting factor to credible simulations of future atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Analyses of the atmospheric gradients of CO2 and "CO2 concentrations provide increasingly strong evidence for terrestrial sinks, potentially distributed between North-em Hemisphere and tropical regions, but conclusive detection in direct biomass and soil measurements remains elusive. Current regional-to-global terrestrial ecosystem models with coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles represent the effects of CO2 fertilization differently, but all suggest long-term responses to CO2 that are substantially smaller than potential leaf-or laboratory whole plant-level responses. Analyses of emissions and biogeochemical fluxes consistent with eventual stabilization of atmospheric CO2 concentrations are sensitive to the way in which biospheric feedbacks are modeled by c. 15\%. Decisions about land use can have effects of 100s of Gt C over the next few centuries, with similarly significant effects on the atmosphere. Critical areas for future research are continued measurements and analyses of atmo-spheric data (CO2 and \^\^CO2) to serve as large-scale constraints, process studies of the scaling from the photosynthetic response to CO2 to whole-ecosystem carbon storage, and rigorous quantification of the effects of changing land use on carbon storage.},

  abstract = {The incorporation of legume cover crops into annual grain rotations remains limited, despite extensive evidence that they can reduce negative environmental impacts of agroecosystems while maintaining crop yields. Diversified grain rotations that include a winter cereal have a unique niche for interseeding cover crops. To understand how man- agement-driven soil fertility differences and inter- seeding with grains influenced red clover (Trifolium pratense)N2 fixation, we estimated biological N2 fixation (BNF) in 2006 and 2007, using the 15N natural abundance method across 15 farm fields characterized based on the reliance on BNF derived N inputs as a fraction of total N inputs. Plant treatments included winter grain with and without interseeded red clover, monoculture clover, mono- culture orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata), and clo- ver-orchardgrass mixtures. Fields with a history of legume-based management had larger labile soil nitrogen pools and lower soil P levels. Orchardgrass biomass was positively correlated with the manage- ment-induced N fertility gradient, but we did not detect any relationship between soil N availability and clover N2 fixation. Interseeding clover with a winter cereal did not alter winter grain yield, however, clover production was lower during the establishment year when interseeded with taller winter grain varieties, most likely due to competition for light. Interseeding clover increased the \% N from fixation relative to the monoculture clover (72\% vs. 63\%, respectively) and the average total N2 fixed at the end of the first growing season (57 vs. 47 kg N ha-1, respectively). Similar principles could be applied to develop more cash crop-cover crop complementary pairings that provide both an annual grain harvest and legume cover crop benefits.},

We also compared arctic soils with soils from a wide range of more temperate biomes to characterize variability in soil bacterial communities across the globe. We show that arctic soil bacterial community composition and diversity are structured according to local variation in soil pH rather than geographical proximity to neighboring sites, suggesting that local environmental heterogeneity is far more important than dispersal limitation in determining community-level differences. Furthermore, bacterial community composition had similar levels of variability, richness and phylogenetic diversity within arctic soils as across soils from a wide range of lower latitudes, strongly suggesting a common diversity structure within soil bacterial communities around the globe. These results contrast with the well-established latitudinal gradients in animal and plant diversity, suggesting that the controls on bacterial community distributions are fundamentally different from those observed for macro-organisms and that our biome definitions are not useful for predicting variability in soil bacterial communities across the globe.},

  volume = {85},
  issn = {01682563},
  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a structure for organo-mineral associations in soils based on recent insights concerning the molecular structure of soil organic matter (SOM), and on extensive published evidence from empirical studies of organo-mineral interfaces. Our conceptual model assumes that SOM consists of a heterogeneous mixture of compounds that display a range of amphiphilic or surfactant-like properties, and are capable of self-organization in aqueous solution. An extension of this self-organizational behavior in solution, we suggest that SOM sorbs to mineral surfaces in a discrete zonal sequence. In the contact zone, the formation of particularly strong organo-mineral associations appears to be favored by situations where either (i) polar organic functional groups of amphiphiles interact via ligand exchange with singly coordinated mineral hydroxyls, forming stable inner-sphere complexes, or (ii) proteinaceous materials unfold upon adsorption, thus increasing adhesive strength by adding hydrophobic interactions to electrostatic binding. Entropic considerations dictate that exposed hydrophobic portions of amphiphilic molecules adsorbed directly to mineral surfaces be shielded from the polar aqueous phase through association with hydrophobic moieties of other amphiphilic molecules. This process can create a membrane-like bilayer containing a hydrophobic zone, whose components may exchange more easily with the surrounding soil solution than those in the contact zone, but which are still retained with considerable force. Sorbed to the hydrophilic exterior of hemimicellar coatings, or to adsorbed proteins, are organic molecules forming an outer region, or kinetic zone, that is loosely retained by cation bridging, hydrogen bonding, and other interactions. Organic material in the kinetic zone may experience high exchange rates with the surrounding soil solution, leading to short residence times for individual molecular fragments. The thickness of this outer region would depend more on input than on the availability of binding sites, and would largely be controlled by exchange kinetics. Movement of organics into and out of this outer region can thus be viewed as similar to a phase-partitioning process. The zonal concept of organo-mineral interactions presented here offers a new basis for understanding and predicting the retention of organic compounds, including contaminants, in soils and sediments. \textcopyright{} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

Glaciated landscapes record the erosional legacy of glacial intervals through moraine deposits and U-shaped valleys, whereas more widespread unglaciated hillslopes and rivers lack ob-vious climate signatures, hampering mechanistic theory for how climate sets fluxes and form. Today, periglacial pro-cesses in high-elevation settings promote vigorous bedrock-to-regolith conversion and regolith transport, but the extent to which frost processes shaped vast swaths of low-to moderate-elevation terrain during past climate regimes is not well established. By combining a mechanistic frost weathering model with a regional Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) climate reconstruction derived from a paleo-Earth System Model, paleovegetation data, and a paleoerosion archive, we propose that frost-driven sediment production was pervasive during the LGM in our unglaciated Pacific Northwest study site, coincident with a 2.5 times increase in erosion relative to modern rates. Our findings provide a novel framework to quantify how climate modulates sediment production over glacial-interglacial cycles in mid-latitude unglaciated terrain.},

  abstract = {Organic producers in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA are interested in reducing tillage, labor and time requirements for grain production. Cover crop-based, organic rotational no-till grain production is one approach to accomplish these goals. This approach is becoming more viable with advancements in a system for planting crops into cover crop residue flattened by a roller-crimper. However, inability to consistently control weeds, particularly perennial weeds, is a major constraint. Cover crop biomass can be increased by manipulating seeding rate, timing of planting and fertility to achieve levels (8000 kg ha-1) necessary for suppressing summer annual weeds. However, while cover crops are multi-functional tools, when enhancing performance for a given function there are trade-off with other functions. While cover crop management is required for optimal system performance, integration into a crop rotation becomes a critical challenge to the overall success of the production system. Further, high levels of cover crop biomass can constrain crop establishment by reducing optimal seed placement, creating suitable habitat for seed- and seedling-feeding herbivores, and impeding placement of supplemental fertilizers. Multi-institutional and -disciplinary teams have been working in the mid-Atlantic region to address system constraints and management trade-off challenges. Here, we report on past and current research on cover crop-based organic rotational no-till grain production conducted in the mid-Atlantic region.},

  abstract = {In order to examine the effects of disturbance, vegetation type, and microclimate on denitrification and denitrifier community composition, experimental plots were established at the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Soil cores were reciprocally transplanted between meadow and forest and samples were collected after 1 and 2 years. Denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA) was measured using the acetylene block assay and terminal restriction length polymorphism profiles were generated with nosZ primers that target the gene coding for nitrous oxide reductase. Nitrate concentrations, C mineralization, and water content were measured to gain additional insights into soil properties controlling DEA. Meadow soils were significantly higher in DEA than forest soils, and the highest DEA levels were observed in cores transferred from the meadow into the forest. Nitrate concentrations were also different between forest and meadow soils, but did not correlate to DEA. DEA was higher in open versus closed cores, suggesting an association between denitrification and the rhizosphere. Denitrifier communities of undisturbed forest and meadow soils shifted through a 4-year period but remained distinct from each other. Similarly, denitrifier communities clustered by vegetation type of origin regardless of manipulation, suggesting that the overall denitrifier communities are well buffered against environmental changes. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Weed management is one of the primary challenges for producers transitioning from conventional to organic agriculture. Tillage and the use of cover crops are two weed control tactics available to farmers transitioning to organic management, but little is known about their interactive effects on soil quality during the transition period. We investigated the response of soils to tillage and initial cover crop during the 3-year transition to organic in a cover crop-soybean (Glycine max)-maize (Zea mays) rotation in the Mid-Atlantic region of the USA. The tillage treatment contrasted full, inversion tillage with moldboard plowing (FT) versus reduced tillage with chisel plowing (RT). The cover crop treatment contrasted annual versus mostly perennial species during the first year of the rotation. The experiment was initiated twice (Start 1 and Start 2), in consecutive years in adjacent fields. By the end of the experiment, labile carbon, electrical conductivity, pH and soil moisture were all greater under RT than under FT in both starts. Soil organic matter and several other soil attributes were greater under RT than under FT in Start 1, but not in Start 2, perhaps owing to differences between starts in initial field conditions and realized weather. Soil attributes did not differ between the two cover crop treatments. Combining our soils results with agronomic and economic analyses on these plots suggests that using RT during the organic transition can increase soil quality without compromising yield and profitability.},

  abstract = {Silicon has a crucial role in many biogeochemical processes--for example, as a nutrient for marine and terrestrial biota, in buffering soil acidification and in the regulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Traditionally, silica fluxes to soil solutions and stream waters are thought to be controlled by the weathering and subsequent dissolution of silicate minerals. Rates of mineral dissolution can be enhanced by biological processes. But plants also take up considerable quantities of silica from soil solution, which is recycled into the soil from falling litter in a separate soil-plant silica cycle that can be significant in comparison with weathering input and hydrologic output. Here we analyse soil water in basaltic soils across the Hawaiian islands to assess the relative contributions of weathering and biogenic silica cycling by using the distinct signatures of the two processes in germanium/silicon ratios. Our data imply that most of the silica released to Hawaiian stream water has passed through the biogenic silica pool, whereas direct mineral-water reactions account for a smaller fraction of the stream silica flux. We expect that other systems exhibiting strong Si depletion of the mineral soils and/or high Si uptake rates by biomass will also have strong biological control on silica cycling and export.},

  abstract = {Soil microorganisms are critical to ecosystem functioning and the maintenance of soil fertility. However, despite global increases in the inputs of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to ecosystems due to human activities, we lack a predictive understanding of how microbial communities respond to elevated nutrient inputs across environmental gradients. Here we used high-throughput sequencing of marker genes to elucidate the responses of soil fungal, archaeal, and bacterial communities using an N and P addition experiment replicated at 25 globally distributed grassland sites. We also sequenced metagenomes from a subset of the sites to determine how the functional attributes of bacterial communities change in response to elevated nutrients. Despite strong compositional differences across sites, microbial communities shifted in a consistent manner with N or P additions, and the magnitude of these shifts was related to the magnitude of plant community responses to nutrient inputs. Mycorrhizal fungi and methanogenic archaea decreased in relative abundance with nutrient additions, as did the relative abundances of oligotrophic bacterial taxa. The metagenomic data provided additional evidence for this shift in bacterial life history strategies because nutrient additions decreased the average genome sizes of the bacterial community members and elicited changes in the relative abundances of representative functional genes. Our results suggest that elevated N and P inputs lead to predictable shifts in the taxonomic and functional traits of soil microbial communities, including increases in the relative abundances of faster-growing, copiotrophic bacterial taxa, with these shifts likely to impact belowground ecosystems worldwide.},

  abstract = {Methane production in anaerobically incubated soil depends strongly on temperature. Reported values of Q 10 , which is the relative increase in activity after an increase in temperature of 108C, are between 1.3 and 28. We attempted to explain this large variation by considering processes underlying methane production, namely anaerobic carbon mineralisation, reduction of alternative electron acceptors and increased methanogenic activity, each having a well accepted Q 10 value of about 2. Q 10 is hypothesised to vary due to a temperature-dependent lag time with alternative electron reduction before methane production starts (in incubation experiments). Slurried peat samples were incubated at 4, 10, 13.5, 20 and 308C, and carbon dioxide, CH 4 and fatty acids were intensively monitored for 98 d. The temperature dependence of anaerobic C-mineralisation could be described with Q 10 values of 1.1 (4{$\pm$}13.58C) and 1.5 (13.5{$\pm$}308C). For other biological processes we assumed a common Q 10 of 2. The experiment at 13.58C was used to calibrate a temperature adapted version of a recently developed simulation model. This model was used to study the dynamic interactions of the temperature dependent subprocesses and simulated CH 4 production at dierent temperatures reasonably well. At low temperatures, electron acceptors and methanogenic biomass limit methane production for a longer time leading to low methane production at low temperatures. This explains why the overall Q 10 value calculated from both model (Q 10 2{$\pm$}23) and experiment (Q 10 2.9{$\pm$}3.6) varied in time and was larger than the Q 10 values of the individual subprocesses (Q 10 1.1{$\pm$}2). Some of the reported high overall Q 10 values could be explained in the same way. \#},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter is the largest terrestrial carbon pool1. The pool size depends on the balance between formation of soil organic matter from decomposition of plant litter and its mineralization to inorganic carbon. Knowledge of soil organic matter formation remains limited2 and current C numerical models assume that stable soil organic matter is formed primarily from recalcitrant plant litter3. However, labile components of plant litter could also form mineral-stabilized soil organic matter4. Here we followed the decomposition of isotopically labelled above-ground litter and its incorporation into soil organic matter over three years in a grassland in Kansas,USA, and used laboratory incubations to determine the decay rates and pool structure of litter-derived organic matter. Early in decomposition, soil organic matter formed when non-structural compounds were lost from litter. Soil organic matter also formed at the end of decomposition, when both non-structural and structural compounds were lost at similar rates.We conclude that two pathways yield soil organic matter effciently. A dissolved organic matter\textendash{}microbial path occurs early in decomposition when litter loses mostly non-structural compounds, which are incorporated into microbial biomass at high rates, resulting in effcient soil organic matter formation. An equally effcient physical-transfer path occurs when litter fragments move into soil.},

  volume = {96},
  issn = {00220477},
  abstract = {1. A major challenge in predicting biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning is to understand the linkages between above-ground and below-ground components in natural communities. However, incongruities in spatial and temporal scale between plant and soil processes, and confounding ecological factors, have impeded our understanding of biodiversity effects on below-ground processes, particularly in natural ecosystems with long-lived species such as forests. 2. We designed an approach to isolate plant species composition effects from other ecosystem factors, in order to evaluate the effects of individual tree species and tree species mixtures on litter decomposition in a mixed old-growth forest in temperate South America. We identified `tree triangles' where the intersection of plant canopies directly controlled micro-environmental and biogeochemical conditions on the forest floor. The monospecific treatment included triangles composed of three trees of a single species of Nothofagus dombeyi , N. obliqua or N. nervosa , while the mixed-species triangles consisted in the intersections of the three different Nothofagus species. 3. We placed litterbags with N. dombeyi , N. obliqua or N. nervosa litter and mixed litter of the three species within all these triangles and estimated the decomposition constant ( k ) after 1 year of incubation. We also used a standard litter type in all triangles to independently evaluate the tree triangle effects on decomposition. 4. We found that plant species affected decomposition through both direct and indirect effects. Direct effects were mediated through leaf litter quality, while indirect effects were related to unique conditions that the plant species created in the surrounding environment. Despite litter decomposition variation among triangles, standard soil biogeochemical conditions such as soil C : N ratios, microbial biomass and pH were similar among microsites. 5. Most interestingly, we explicitly demonstrated that long-term effects of plant species created specific conditions that enhanced decomposition of their own litter, establishing affinity effects between single-species litter and their own microenvironment. 6. Synthesis. Our results highlight that plant species identity and long-term plant\textendash{}soil feedbacks are important in affecting litter decomposition in this temperate Patagonian forest. Thus, changes or losses in temperate forest above-ground biodiversity can directly impact litter decomposition both through changes in litter quality inputs and, additionally, through the loss of specific plant\textendash{} soil interactions that affect below-ground processes.},

  abstract = {Four two-year field trials, arranged in randomised split-plots, were carried out in southern Sweden with the aim of determining whether reduced N fertiliser dose in winter wheat production with spring under-sown clover cover crops, with or without perennial ryegrass in the seed mixture, would increase the clover biomass and hence the benefits of the cover crops in terms of the effect on the wheat crop, on a subsequent barley crop and on the risk of N leaching. Four doses of nitrogen (0, 60, 120 or 180kgNha-1) constituted the main plots and six cover crop treatments the sub-plots. The cover crop treatments were red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) in pure stands and in mixtures. The winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was harvested in August and the cover crops were ploughed under in November. The risk of N leaching was assessed in November by measuring the content of mineral N in the soil profile (0-30, 30-90cm). In the following year, the residual effects of the cover crops were investigated in spring barley (Hordeum distichon L.) without additional N. Under-sowing of cover crops did not influence wheat yield, while reduced N fertiliser dose decreased yield and increased the clover content of the cover crops. When N was applied, the mixed cover crops were as effective in depleting soil mineral nitrogen as a pure ryegrass cover crop, while pure clover was less efficient. The clover content at wheat harvest as well as the amount of N incorporated with the cover crops had a positive correlation with barley yield. Spring barley in the unfertilised treatments yielded, on average, 1.9-2.4MgDMha-1 more in treatments with clover cover crops than in the treatment without cover crops. However, this positive effect decreased as the N dose to the preceding wheat crop increased, particularly when the clover was mixed with grass. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {This review covers historical perspectives, the role of plant inputs, and the nature and dynamics of soil organic matter (SOM), often known as humus. Information on turnover of organic matter components, the role of microbial products, and modeling of SOM, and tracer research should help us to anticipate what future research may answer today's challenges. Our globe's most important natural resource is best studied relative to its chemistry, dynamics, matrix interactions, and microbial transformations. Humus has similar, worldwide characteristics, but varies with abiotic controls, soil type, vegetation inputs and composition, and the soil biota. It contains carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, phenol-aromatics, protein-derived and cyclic nitrogenous compounds, and some still unknown compounds. Protection of transformed plant residues and microbial products occurs through spatial inaccessibility-resource availability, aggregation of mineral and organic constituents, and interactions with sesquioxides, cations, silts, and clays. Tracers that became available in the mid-20th century made the study of SOM dynamics possible. Carbon dating identified resistant, often mineral-associated, materials to be thousands of years old, especially at depth in the profile. The 13C associated with C3C4 plant switches characterized slow turnover pools with ages ranging from dozens to hundreds of years. Added tracers, in conjunction with compound-specific product analysis and incubation, identified active pools with fast turnover rates. Physical fractionations of the intra- and inter-aggregate materials, and those associated with silt and clay, showed that all pools contain both old and young materials. Charcoal is old but not inert. The C:N ratio changes from 25 to 70:1 for plant residues to 6 to 9:1 for soil biota and microbial products associated with soil minerals. Active, slow and passive (resistant) pool concepts have been well used in biogeochemical models. The concepts discussed herein have implications for today's challenges in nutrient cycling, biogeochemistry, soil ecosystem functioning, pollution control, feeding the expanding global population and global change.},

  abstract = {This article discusses the mitigation and adaptation potential of organic agricultural systems along three main features: farming system design, cropland management and grassland and livestock management. An important potential contribution of organically managed systems to climate change mitigation is identified in the careful management of nutrients and, hence, the reduction of N2O emissions from soils. Another high mitigation potential of organic agriculture lies in carbon sequestration in soils. In a first estimate, the emission reduction potential by abstention from mineral fertilizers is calculated to be about 20\% and the compensation potential by carbon sequestration to be about 40\textendash{}72\% of the world's current annual agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but further research is needed to consolidate these numbers. On the adaptation side, organic agriculture systems have a strong potential for building resilient food systems in the face of uncertainties, through farm diversification and building soil fertility with organic matter. Additionally, organic agriculture offers alternatives to energy-intensive production inputs such as synthetic fertilizers which are likely to be further limited for poor rural populations by rising energy prices. In developing countries, organic agricultural systems achieve equal or even higher yields, as compared to the current conventional practices, which translate into a potentially important option for food security and sustainable livelihoods for the rural poor in times of climate change. Certified organic products cater for higher income options for farmers and, therefore, can serve as promoters for climate-friendly farming practices worldwide.},

A silty clay loam (Fluventic Ustochrept) located in south-central Texas, USA, was sampled to a depth of 200 mm 57 times during a 2-yr period. In situ soil NO 3- accumulated at a daily rate of \~ 0.03 g N/m following harvest when temperature and moisture were adequate. Potential soil C mineralization was 35, 39, and 53\% greater under NT than under CT when averaged across months in wheat, sorghum, and soyabean, resp. However, following harvest of each crop, potential soil C mineralization increased at a faster rate under CT than under NT and differences between tillage regimes were reduced for several months, which caused temporary N immobilization in CT. Periods of net N immobilization at the end of the growing season and beginning of the fallow period were often associated with an increasing SMBC pool. Large seasonal changes in active soil C and N pools could be related to rhizodeposition, crop residue addition, and the long fallow period. The type, placement, and timing of residue input significantly altered the seasonal dynamics of the active soil C and N pools and their effect on soil N availability.},

  volume = {99},

  abstract = {Environmental conditions exert strong controls on the activity of saprotrophic microbes, yet abiotic factors often fail to adequately predict wood decomposition rates across broad spatial scales. Given that species interactions can have significant positive and negative effects on wood-decay fungal activity, one possibility is that biotic processes serve as the primary controls on community function, with abiotic controls emerging only after species associations are accounted for. Here we explore this hypothesis in a factorial field warming- and nitrogen-addition experiment by examining relationships among wood decomposition rates, fungal activity, and fungal community structure. We show that functional outcomes and community structure are largely unrelated to abiotic conditions, with microsite and plot-level abiotic variables explaining at most 19\% of the total variability in decomposition and fungal activity, and 2\% of the variability in richness and evenness. In contrast, taxonomic richness, evenness, and species associations (i.e., co-occurrence patterns) exhibited strong relationships with community function, accounting for 52\% of the variation in decomposition rates and 73\% in fungal activity. A greater proportion of positive vs. negative species associations in a community was linked to strong declines in decomposition rates and richness. Evenness emerged as a key mediator between richness and function, with highly even communities exhibiting a positive richness\textendash{}function relationship and uneven communities exhibiting a negative or null response. These results suggest that community-assembly processes and species interactions are important controls on the function of wood-decay fungal communities, ultimately overwhelming substantial differences in abiotic conditions.},

Glacial erosion rates are high and the sediments produced are distinctively fine grained, hence glaciers can be thought of as producers of mineral surface area.

More significant effects may be associated with silt deposited in loess and on continental margins. Thick deposits in both settings contribute to carbon cycling through both silicate weathering and organic carbon burial. The impact of glaciers on biogeochemical cycles will be long-lasting, as the legacy of glacial erosion processes continues as long as sediment yields are elevated.},

  abstract = {Modeling the multivariate spatial distribution of soil carbon and nutrients has been a challenge for ecosystem ecologists. There is a need for explanatory models, which give insight into socio-economic and biophysical controls on soil spatial variability. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian modeling specification, an approach that takes into account the spatial covariates as well as the inter-dependent nature of soil nutrients and carbon pools. We develop the model to explain variability in soil nutrient and carbon pools in the Central Arizona Phoenix Metropolitan region where soil-composition has changed considerably over the years due to socio-economic factors. A fully Bayesian statistical analysis of how these changes have affected soil nutrients provides insight as to how socio-economics influence changes in ecology. Our model included five geomorphic, ecological, and socio-economic independent variables that were used to predict soil total N, organic C, inorganic C, and extractable PO(4)(3-). Using six levels of hierarchy, we fit a suitable spatial hierarhical model. Using a Bayesian co-kriging strategy, we generate appropriate values used for predictions at new locations where covariate information is unavailable. We compare prediction results from standard models and show that our model is richer and so is the interpretation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies hierarchical Bayesian modeling techniques and kriging strategies to study multivarate soil nutrient and carbon concentrations. We conclude a discussion of our findings and the broader ecological applicability of our modeling style.},

  abstract = {Understanding the role of soil microbial communities in coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles has become an area of great interest as we strive to understand how global change will influence ecosystem function. In this endeavor, microbially explicit decomposition models are being adopted because they include microbial stoichiometry- and biomass-mediated mechanisms that may be important in shaping ecosystemresponse to environmental change. Yet there has been a dearth of empirical tests to verify the predictions of these models and hence identify potential improvements.We measured the response of soilmicrobes to multiple rates of carbon and nitrogen amendment in experimental microcosms, and used the respiration and nitrogen mineralization responses to assess a well-established, single-pool, microbial decomposition model. The model generally predicted the empirical trends in carbon and nitrogen fluxes, but failed to predict the empirical trends in microbial biomass. Further examination of this discontinuity indicated that the model successfully predicted carbon and nitrogen cycling because stoichiometry overrodemicrobial biomass as a regulator of cycling rates. Stoichiometric controlmeant that the addition of carbon generally increased respiration and decreased nitrogen mineralization, whereas nitrogen had the opposite effects. Biomass only assumed importance as a control on cycling rates when stoichiometric ratios of resource inputs were a close match to those of the microbial biomass. Our work highlights the need to advance our understanding of the stoichiometric demands of microbial biomass in order to better understand biogeochemical cycles in the face of changing organic- and inorganic-matter inputs to terrestrial ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Increasing plant diversity in agroecosystems with cover crops has been a successful strategy to augment ecosystem services from agriculture, and increasing diversity of cover crops may provide even greater benefits. Productivity and ecosystem services from multi-species cover crop mixtures were measured in a 2-yr field study of 18 cover crop treatments preceding conventionally tilled corn in central Pennsylvania. Increasing the number of species in a stand increased cover crop biomass (R2 = 0.15). However, mixing cover crop species that were complementary in phenology or N acquisition strategy did not result in mixtures that produced more biomass than high yielding monocultures. Increasing cover crop biomass was positively correlated with several ecosystem services, namely weed suppression, prevention of nitrate leaching, and aboveground biomass N, but negatively impacted inorganic N availability and corn yield in the subsequent cropping season. The cover crop C/N ratio was another determinant of ecosystem services positively related to nitrate leaching prevention, but negatively related to inorganic N availability and corn yield. This study supports the long-held assumption that increasing biomass can enhance certain ecosystem services from cover crops; however, because the mixtures tested did not produce more biomass than high yielding monocultures, opportunities to increase biomass-driven services with mixtures may be limited. The correlation between biomass C/N ratio and ecosystem services in this study also indicates that functional traits, as opposed to biomass alone, will be important for predicting ecosystem services from cover crop mixtures.},

  abstract = {A molecular analysis of betaproteobacterial ammonia oxidizers and a N(2)O isotopomer analysis were conducted to study the sources of N(2)O emissions during the cow manure composting process. Much NO(2)(-)-N and NO(3)(-)-N and the Nitrosomonas europaea-like amoA gene were detected at the surface, especially at the top of the composting pile, suggesting that these ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) significantly contribute to the nitrification which occurs at the surface layer of compost piles. However, the (15)N site preference within the asymmetric N(2)O molecule (SP = delta(15)N(alpha) - delta(15)N(beta), where (15)N(alpha) and (15)N(beta) represent the (15)N/(14)N ratios at the center and end sites of the nitrogen atoms, respectively) indicated that the source of N(2)O emissions just after the compost was turned originated mainly from the denitrification process. Based on these results, the reduction of accumulated NO(2)(-)-N or NO(3)(-)-N after turning was identified as the main source of N(2)O emissions. The site preference and bulk delta(15)N results also indicate that the rate of N(2)O reduction was relatively low, and an increased value for the site preference indicates that the nitrification which occurred mainly in the surface layer of the pile partially contributed to N(2)O emissions between the turnings.},

  abstract = {Identifying the importance of fungi to nitrous oxide (N2O) production requires a non-intrusive method for differentiating between fungal and bacterialN2Oproduction such as natural abundance stable isotopes.Wecompare the isotopologue composition ofN2Oproduced during nitrite reduction by the fungal denitrifiers Fusarium oxysporum and Cylindrocarpon tonkinense with published data for N2O production during bacterial nitrification and denitrification. The fractionation factors for bulk nitrogen isotope values for fungal denitrification were in the range S74.7 to S6.6\%. There was an inverse relationship between the absolute value of the fractionation factors and the reaction rate constant. We interpret this in terms of variation in the relative importance of the rate constants for diffusion and enzymatic reduction in controlling the net isotope effect for N2O production during fungal denitrification. Over the course of nitrite reduction, the d18Ovalues forN2Oremained constant and did not exhibit a relationship with the concentration characteristic of an isotope effect. This probably reflects isotopic exchange with water. Similar to the d18O data, the site preference (SP; the difference in d15N between the central and outer N atoms in N2O) was unrelated to concentration during nitrite reduction and, therefore, has the potential to act as a conservative tracer of production from fungal denitrification. The SP values ofN2Oproduced by F. oxysporum and C. tonkinense were 37.1W2.5\% and 36.9W2.8\%, respectively. These SP values are similar to those obtained in pure culture studies of bacterial nitrification but quite distinct from SP values for bacterial denitrification. The large magnitude of the bulk nitrogen isotope fractionation and the d18O values associated with fungal denitrification are distinct from bacterial production pathways; thus multiple isotopologue data holds much promise for resolving bacterial and fungal production. Our work further provides insight into the role that fungal and bacterial nitric oxide reductases have in determining site preference during N2O production.},

  issn = {00167061},
  abstract = {Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of precipitation, but our ability to model the consequences for soil respiration are limited by a lack of data from soils that are saturated and draining. In this study, we used large intact soil columns (28??30cm) to 1) quantify changes in CO2 flux as soils drain from saturated conditions, and 2) to determine which soil water metrics best predict instantaneous maximum CO2 flux. The columns were from three agricultural landscape positions that vary in soil properties. We simulated water table fluctuations that were observed at the field site (and predicted to increase in future climate scenarios) by flooding the columns from bottom to surface and then allowing the columns to drain for 96h while monitoring volumetric soil water content (VWC), water filled pore space (WFPS), water content normalized to field capacity, matric potential, and CO2 flux. Mean cumulative CO2 flux was 4649mg CO2-Cm-2 96h-1. Regardless of landscape position, CO2 flux rates exhibited a single maximum slightly below saturation, near field capacity. This result suggests that many field studies have not captured soil respiration rates when water availability is optimum for heterotrophic respiration. Across landscape positions, matric potential was the most consistent indicator of instantaneous maximum CO2 flux, with maximum fluxes occurring within the narrow range of -0.15 to -4.89kPa. In contrast, instantaneous maximum CO2 flux rates occurred between 95 and 131\% of water content normalized to field capacity, 72-97\% WFPS, and 29-45\% VWC. Thus, our data suggest that instantaneous maximum CO2 flux rates, a key parameter in ecosystem models, can be predicted across an agricultural landscape with diverse soils if matric potential is used as a water scalar. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Organic farmers are encouraged to adopt conservation tillage to preserve soil quality and fertility and to prevent soil degradation \textendash{} mainly erosion and compaction. The potential advantages of conservation tillage in organic farming are reduced erosion, greater macroporosity in the soil surface due to larger number of earthworms, more microbial activity and carbon storage, less run-off and leaching of nutrients, reduced fuel use and faster tillage. The disadvantages of conservation tillage in organic farming are greater pressure from grass weeds, less suitable than ploughing for poorly drained, unstable soils or high rainfall areas, restricted N availability and restricted crop choice. The success of conservation tillage in organic farming hinges on the choice of crop rotation to ensure weed and disease control and nitrogen availability. Rotation of tillage depth according to crop type, in conjunction with compaction control measures is also required. A high standard of management is required, tailored to local soil and site conditions. Innovative approaches for the application of conservation tillage, such as perennial mulches, mechanical control of cover crops, rotational tillage and controlled traffic, require further practical assessment.},

Recent work shows that a better understanding of the composition and diversity of the microbial community across a variety of soils in different climates and under different land use, as well as plant-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere, may provide a key to better understand the variability of N2O fluxes at the soil-atmosphere interface. Moreover, recent insights into the regulation of the reduction of N2O to dinitrogen (N2) have increased our understanding of N2O exchange. This improved process understanding, building on the increased use of isotope tracing techniques and metagenomics, needs to go along with improvements in measurement techniques for N2O (and N2) emission in order to obtain robust field and laboratory datasets for different ecosystem types. Advances in both fields are currently used to improve process descriptions in biogeochemical models, which may eventually be used not only to test our current process understanding from the microsite to the field level, but also used as tools for up-scaling emissions to landscapes and regions and to explore feedbacks of soil N2O emissions to changes in environmental conditions, land management and land use.},

In aquatic ecosystems, N inputs influence denitrification rates whereas hydrology and geomorphology influence the proportion of N inputs that are denitrified.

  abstract = {The 1966 GENETICS papers by John Hubby and Richard Lewontin were a landmark in the study of genome-wide levels of variability. They used the technique of gel electrophoresis of enzymes and proteins to study variation in natural populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura, at a set of loci that had been chosen purely for technical convenience, without prior knowledge of their levels of variability. Together with the independent study of human populations by Harry Harris, this seminal study provided the first relatively unbiased picture of the extent of genetic variability in protein sequences within populations, revealing that many genes had surprisingly high levels of diversity. These papers stimulated a large research program that found similarly high electrophoretic variability in many different species and led to statistical tools for interpreting the data in terms of population genetics processes such as genetic drift, balancing and purifying selection, and the effects of selection on linked variants. The current use of whole-genome sequences in studies of variation is the direct descendant of this pioneering work.},

  volume = {28},
  issn = {1742-1705},
  abstract = {ABSTRACT Organic grain cropping systems can enhance a number of ecosystem services compared with conventional tilled (CT) systems. Recent results from a limited number of long-term agricultural research (LTAR) studies suggest that organic grain cropping systems can also increase several ecosystem services relative to conventional no-till (NT) cropping systems: soil C sequestration and soil N fertility (N mineralization potential) can be greater while global warming potential (GWP) can be lower in organic systems that use animal manures and cover crops compared with conventional NT systems. However, soil erosion from organic systems and nitrous oxide (N2O, a greenhouse gas) emissions from manure-based organic systems appear to be greater than from conventional NT systems, though data are limited. Also, crop yields, on average, continue to be lower and labor requirements greater in organic than in both tilled and NT conventional systems. Ecosystem services provided by organic systems may be improved by expanding crop rotations to include greater crop phenological diversity, improving nutrient management, and reducing tillage intensity and frequency. More diverse crop rotations, especially those that include perennial forages, can reduce weed pressure, economic risk, soil erosion, N2O emissions, animal manure inputs, and soil P loading, while increasing grain yield and soil fertility. Side-dressing animal manures in organic systems may increase corn nitrogen use efficiency and also minimize animal manure inputs. Management practices that reduce tillage frequency and intensity in organic systems are being developed to reduce soil erosion and labor and energy needs. On-going research promises to further augment ecosystem services provided by organic grain cropping systems.},

As predicted, the leaders were more assertive in managing subordinate-subordinate conflicts. Unexpectedly, they also pressed their own subordinates quite forcefully in the subordinate-outsider disputes. The second study investigated subordinates' interventions in their leaders' disputes. In these conflicts, subordinates adopted a low-key shuttle diplomacy; meeting separately with the parties, listening to their opinions, transmitting these to the other side, and calling for each side's empathy and understanding.},

  abstract = {Permanganate-oxidizable C (POXC) and mineralizable C (as determined by short-term aerobic incubation of rewetted soil) are measures of active organic matter that may provide early indication of soil C stabilization and mineralization processes. To date, the relationship between these two prom-ising active organic matter tests has not been comprehensively evaluated, and little is known about their functional role in the soil ecosystem. Here, we examined the relationship between POXC and mineralizable C across a wide range of soil types, management histories, and geographic locations across the United states (13 studies, 76 total sites; n = 1071) and the abil-ity of POXC and mineralizable C to predict crop yield and total aboveground biomass. Results from this comparative analysis showed that POXC and mineralizable C are related (r 2 = 0.15\textendash{}0.80) but that the relationship was differentially influenced by management practices. Overall, POXC better reflected practices that promote organic matter accumulation or stabiliza-tion and therefore can be a useful indicator of long-term soil C sequestration. Conversely, mineralizable C better reflected practices that promote organic matter mineralization and therefore can be a useful indicator of short-term soil nutrient availability. Our results also show that both mineralizable C and POXC were better predictors of corn (Zea mays L.) grain yield, aboveground biomass, and tomato (solanum lycopersicum L.) fruit yield than other soil C fractions evaluated here. Thus, the integrated use of POXC and mineralizable C can provide a complementary framework to assess the relative dynamics of soil C stabilization and nutrient mineralization functions in agroecosystems.},

How microbial communities will respond to changes in vegetation and climate, however, are not well understood. We reciprocally transplanted soil cores from under oak canopies and adjacent open grasslands in a California oak-grassland ecosystem to determine how microbial communities respond to changes in the soil environment and the potential consequences for the cycling of carbon. Every 3 months for up to 2 years, we monitored microbial community composition using phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA), microbial biomass, respiration rates, microbial enzyme activities, and the activity of microbial groups by quantifying (13)C uptake from a universal substrate (pyruvate) into PLFA biomarkers. Soil in the open grassland experienced higher maximum temperatures and lower soil water content than soil under the oak canopies. Soil microbial communities in soil under oak canopies were more sensitive to environmental change than those in adjacent soil from the open grassland. Oak canopy soil communities changed rapidly when cores were transplanted into the open grassland soil environment, but grassland soil communities did not change when transplanted into the oak canopy environment. Similarly, microbial biomass, enzyme activities, and microbial respiration decreased when microbial communities were transplanted from the oak canopy soils to the grassland environment, but not when the grassland communities were transplanted to the oak canopy environment. These data support the hypothesis that microbial community composition and function is altered when microbes are exposed to new extremes in environmental conditions; that is, environmental conditions outside of their "life history" envelopes.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) supply in stockless organic farming may be improved through use of grass-clover for anaerobic digestion, producing biogas and digested manure for use as fertilizer in the crop rotation. We studied the effects of grass-clover management on N cycling, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and cash-crop yields in an organic arable crop rotation on a sandy loam soil in a cool temperate climate. The four-course crop rotation included spring barley (with undersown grass-clover), grass-clover, potato and winter wheat (with undersown cover crop). Two fertilization treatments were compared: "-M" where plant material from grass-clover cuts was left in the field to decompose and no fertilizer or manure was applied to any crop in the rotation; and "+M" where plant material from grass-clover cuts was harvested and equivalent amounts of N in digested manure used for fertilization of cash crops in the rotation (spring barley, potato and winter wheat); actual digestion of grass-clover cuttings was not possible, instead digested pig manure was used as substitute for digested grass-clover. Nitrous oxide fluxes were monitored between April 2008 and May 2009. In general, application of digested manure had little or no effect on N2O emissions. Periods of high N2O emissions coincided with cover crop and grass-clover residue turnover, with little added effect of digested manure application. Annual N2O emissions did not vary between fertilization treatments, but the +M treatment had cash crop dry matter yields that were 14\% higher than in the -M treatment, and cash crop N yields were increased by 40\%. The results show that reallocation of nutrients from grass-clover to cash crops following anaerobic digestion can help solve problems with low N availability. However, issues remain regarding N2O from cover crops and grass-clover in spring. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {High nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations and loads in tile drainage waters in response to crop fertility and other land management practices are a major cause of concern to the health of humans, animals and the environment. The study, conducted at Kentville, Nova Scotia (NS), examined the effect of renovating fallowed land with the introduction of either manure amended permanent forage (PF) or manure amended corn (Zea mays L.) - soybean (Glycine max L.) - wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Corn-soybean-wheat (CSW) rotations on growing season (GS) and non-growing season (NGS) nitrate (NO3-N) concentrations and loads of tile drainage water. Treatments included (i) PF rotation established with conventional tillage (CT) practices; (ii) CSW-CT rotation; (iii) minimum tillage in a CSW rotation (CSW-MT) and (iv) zero tillage in a CSW rotation (CSW-ZT). NGS drainage was significantly higher and flow-weighted NO3-N concentrations significantly lower in all years when compared with GS. There were no consistent differences observed in GS or NGS NO3-N concentrations and loads between the three levels of tillage in the CSW rotation with loads ranging between 7.1 and 28.2 kg N L-1 and 18.7 and 77.0 kg N L-1 for GS and NGS, respectively. PF rotation was significantly more efficient in N utilization when compared with a CSW rotation, resulting in significantly lower loads. Decreasing nitrate loads over time appeared to be related to increasing evapo-transpiration and N uptake as the forage matured. Although differences in the amount of N removed by corn, soybean and spring wheat in the CSW rotation were observed, these were not significant in determining the magnitude of NO3-N loads. The correlation between LDM application and NO3-N losses in tile water under this rotation in a particular season proved difficult to define. The study showed that the biological response time of the manured, soil system for NO3-N loading is longer than one seasonal cycle and demonstrates the need to evaluate the long-term impacts of these rotations.

  issn = {00224588},
  abstract = {Drained and undrained grassland lysimeter plots were established in 1982 on a clay loam of the Hallsworth series at a long-term experimental site in south-west England. The plots were continuously grazed by beef cattle, and received fertilizer at either 200 or 400 kg N ha -I per annum to the existing permanent sward, or at 400 kg N ha-' to a new sward, reseeded to perennial ryegrass following cultivation. Drainage water was monitored at V-notch weirs and sampled daily for the analysis of nitrate-N. Seven years of data are presented (five years for the reseeded swards). On the drained plots a large proportion of the rainfall was routed preferentially down large pores to the mole drains, whilst on the undrained plots, drainage was mainly by surface runoff. The average quantities of nitrate N leached per year were 38.5,133.8 and 55.7 kg ha-' from the old sward that received 200 and 400 kg N ha-', and from the reseed that received 400 kg N ha-' fertilizer, respectively. Ploughing and reseeding resulted in a two-fold reduction in leaching, except during the first winter after ploughing, and twice as much leaching occurred after a hot, dry summer as after a cool, wet one. Nitrate concentrations in drainage from either drained or undrained plots were rather insensitive to rainfall intensity, such that concentration was a good predictor of nitrate load for a given drainage volume. The drainage volume deter- mined the proportion of the leachable N that remained in the soil after the winter drainage period. Initial (peak) concentrations of nitrate N ranged, on average, from 55 mg dm-3 for the drained old sward that received 400 kg N ha-' fertilizer, to 12 mg dm-3 for the undrained sward at 200 kg N ha-' fertilizer input. Concentrations of nitrate N in drainage from similar, unfertilized plots rarely exceeded 1 mg dm-3. The results suggest that manipulating the nitrate supply can lessen leaching and that the route of water through soil to the watercourse determines the maximum nitrate concentration for a given load.},

Thus, a positive relationship between the abundance of gene or transcripts and corresponding process rates is often assumed. To test this assumption, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relationships between gene and/or transcript abundances and corresponding process rates. We identified 415 studies that quantified the abundance of genes or transcripts for enzymes involved in carbon or nitrogen cycling. However, in only 59 of these manuscripts did the authors report both gene or transcript abundance and rates of the appropriate process. We found that within studies there was a significant but weak positive relationship between gene abundance and the corresponding process. Correlations were not strengthened by accounting for habitat type, differences among genes or reaction products versus reactants, suggesting that other ecological and methodological factors may affect the strength of this relationship. Our findings highlight the need for fundamental research on the factors that control transcription, translation and enzyme function in natural systems to better link genomic and transcriptomic data to ecosystem processes.},

  abstract = {Measurements of soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have gained a lot of attention in an effort to potentially increase agriculture's role in mitigating climate effects. However, it seems not well recognized that the nature of chamber- based GHG data is such that analyses require advanced statistical techniques to fully explore experimental treatment effects. Moreover, for soil GHG data some experimental design approaches can enhance while others can weaken a study's ability to detect treatment differences. Here we identify and explore the implications of key choices in experimental design and statistical analyses relevant to chamber-based soil GHG studies. In particular, we discuss (i) relative contributions of different sources of random variability in GHG field studies, (ii) relative benefits of increasing the numbers of samples at different replication levels to increase statistical power, and (iii) benefits of accounting for heterogeneous variances and using repeated measures analysis in GHG studies. Emissions data for CO2 and N2O collected from three experimental sites in Michigan demonstrated high spatial and temporal variability for CO2 and N2O fluxes. For both gases the total variability is dominated by small-scale spatiotemporal variability sources, which constituted 55\% of the total variability for CO2 and 95\% for N2O fluxes. While increasing the number of replicate plots is the main route of rising statistical power, increasing the number of subsamples (chambers and gas samples) per replicate plot can also provide substantial gains. Judicious repeated measures analysis and especially accounting for heterogeneous variances are important strategies for the efficient analysis of chamber-based GHG data.},

As a leguminous cover crop, red clover boosts agro-ecological resilience and productivity through nitrogen fixation, as well as non-nitrogen-related contributions, such as soil temperature and moisture regulation; reduction of erosion, runoff, and leaching; weed suppression; and interruption of pest and disease cycles. The objective of this paper is to propose a system that extends red clover usage into the corn phase of the corn\textendash{}soy\textendash{}wheat rotation as a living mulch. The system incorporates strip-tillage, strip-mowing, as well as banded herbicide and fertilizer application in order to maximize productivity and minimize competition. We analyzed the feasibility of this proposal by examining red clover's adequacy for the proposed system in comparison with other broadleaf, leguminous cover crops, and assessed potential agro-ecological benefits. We considered logistical components of the proposition, including the use of strip-tillage, the application of precision technology, as well as the opportunity for further technological developments. We found that the proposed system has potential to increase agro-ecological sustainability, resilience, and the overall productivity of this three-year rotation. Thus, this easily-implemented practice should be formally studied.},

  abstract = {We evaluated the ecological thresholds associated with vegetation and soil responses to nitrogen (N) deposition, by adding NH  4NO  3 in solution at rates of 5, 10 and 30 kg N ha  -1 yr  -1 to plots in a species rich dry meadow alpine community in Rocky Mountain National Park receiving ambient N deposition of 4 kg N ha  -1 yr  -1. To determine the levels of N input that elicited changes, we measured plant species composition annually, and performed one-time measurements of aboveground biomass and N concentrations, soil solution and resin bag inorganic N, soil pH, and soil extractable cations after 3 years of N additions. Our goal was to use these dose-response relationships to provide N critical loads for vegetation and soils for the alpine in Rocky Mountain National Park. Species richness and diversity did not change in response to the treatments, but one indicator species, Carex rupestris increased in cover from 34 to 125\% in response to the treatments. Using the rate of change in cover for C. rupestris in the treatment and the ambient plots, and assuming the change in cover was due solely to N deposition, we estimated a N critical load for vegetation at 3 kg N ha  -1 yr  -1. Inorganic N concentrations in soil solution increased above ambient levels at input rates between 9 kg N ha  -1 yr  -1 (resin bags) and 14 kg N ha  -1 yr  -1 (lysimeters), indicating biotic and abiotic sinks for N deposition are exhausted at these levels. No changes in soil pH or extractable cations occurred in the treatment plots, indicating acidification had not occurred after 3 years. We conclude that N critical loads under 10 kg ha  -1 yr  -1 are needed to prevent future acidification of soils and surface waters, and recommend N critical loads for vegetation at 3 kg N ha  -1 yr  -1 as important for protecting natural plant communities and ecosystem services in Rocky Mountain National Park. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the recognition that environmental change resulting from anthropogenic activities is causing a global decline in biodiversity, much attention has been devoted to understanding how changes in biodiversity may alter levels of ecosystem functioning. Although environmental complexity has long been recognised as a major driving force in evolutionary processes, it has only recently been incorporated into biodiversity-ecosystem functioning investigations. Environmental complexity is expected to strengthen the positive effect of species richness on ecosystem functioning, mainly because it leads to stronger complementarity effects, such as resource partitioning and facilitative interactions among species when the number of available resource increases. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we implemented an experiment to test the combined effect of species richness and environmental complexity, more specifically, resource richness on ecosystem functioning over time. We show, using all possible combinations of species within a bacterial community consisting of six species, and all possible combinations of three substrates, that diversity-functioning (metabolic activity) relationships change over time from linear to saturated. This was probably caused by a combination of limited complementarity effects and negative interactions among competing species as the experiment progressed. Even though species richness and resource richness both enhanced ecosystem functioning, they did so independently from each other. Instead there were complex interactions between particular species and substrate combinations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study shows clearly that both species richness and environmental complexity increase ecosystem functioning. The finding that there was no direct interaction between these two factors, but that instead rather complex interactions between combinations of certain species and resources underlie positive biodiversity ecosystem functioning relationships, suggests that detailed knowledge of how individual species interact with complex natural environments will be required in order to make reliable predictions about how altered levels of biodiversity will most likely affect ecosystem functioning.},

  volume = {9},
  issn = {17264170},
  abstract = {The rewetting of dry soils and the thawing of frozen soils are short-term, transitional phenomena in terms of hydrology and the thermodynamics of soil systems. The impact of these short-term phenomena on larger scale ecosystem fluxes is increasingly recognized, and a growing number of studies show that these events affect fluxes of soil gases such as carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), ammonia (NH3) and nitric oxide (NO). Global climate models predict that future climatic change is likely to alter the frequency and intensity of drying-rewetting events and thawing of frozen soils. These future scenarios highlight the importance of understanding how rewetting and thawing will influence dynamics of these soil gases. This study summarizes findings using a new database containing 338 studies conducted from 1956 to 2011, and highlights open research questions. The database revealed conflicting results following rewetting and thawing in various terrestrial ecosystems and among soil gases, ranging from large increases in fluxes to non-significant changes. Studies reporting lower gas fluxes before rewetting tended to find higher post-rewetting fluxes for CO2, N2O and NO; in addition, increases in N2O flux following thawing were greater in warmer climate regions. We discuss possible mechanisms and controls that regulate flux responses, and recommend that a high temporal resolution of flux measurements is critical to capture rapid changes in gas fluxes after these soil perturbations. Finally, we propose that future studies should investigate the interactions between biological (i.e., microbial community and gas production) and physical (i.e., porosity, diffusivity, dissolution) changes in soil gas fluxes, apply techniques to capture rapid changes (i.e., automated measurements), and explore synergistic experimental and modelling approaches. \textcopyright{} Author(s) 2012.

  volume = {465},
  issn = {00489697},
  abstract = {Globally, substantial quantities of organic amendments (OAs) such as plant residues (3.8??109Mg/yr), biosolids (10??107Mg/yr), and animal manures (7??109Mg/yr) are produced. Recycling these OAs in agriculture possesses several advantages such as improving plant growth, yield, soil carbon content, and microbial biomass and activity. Nevertheless, OA applications hold some disadvantages such as nutrient eutrophication and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Agriculture sector plays a vital role in GHG emission (carbon dioxide- CO2, methane- CH4, and nitrous oxide- N2O). Though CH4 and N2O are emitted in less quantity than CO2, they are 21 and 310 times more powerful in global warming potential, respectively. Although there have been reviews on the role of mineral fertilizer application on GHG emission, there has been no comprehensive review on the effect of OA application on GHG emission in agricultural soils. The review starts with the quantification of various OAs used in agriculture that include manures, biosolids, and crop residues along with their role in improving soil health. Then, it discusses four major OA induced-GHG emission processes (i.e., priming effect, methanogenesis, nitrification, and denitrification) by highlighting the impact of OA application on GHG emission from soil. For example, globally 10??107Mg biosolids are produced annually which can result in the potential emission of 530Gg of CH4 and 60Gg of N2O. The article then aims to highlight the soil, climatic, and OA factors affecting OA induced-GHG emission and the management practices to mitigate the emission. This review emphasizes the future research needs in relation to nitrogen and carbon dynamics in soil to broaden the use of OAs in agriculture to maintain soil health with minimum impact on GHG emission from agriculture. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in the major cereals is critical for more sustainable nitrogen use in high-input agriculture, but our understanding of the potential for NUE improvement is limited by a paucity of reliable on-farm measurements. Limited on-farm data suggest that agronomic NUE (AE(N)) is lower and more variable than data from trials conducted at research stations, on which much of our understanding of AE(N) has been built. The purpose of this study was to determine the magnitude and causes of variability in AE(N) across an agricultural region, which we refer to as the achievement distribution of AE(N). The distribution of simulated AE(N) in 80 farmers' fields in an irrigated wheat system in the Yaqui Valley, Mexico, was compared with trials at a local research center (International Wheat and Maize Improvement Center; CIMMYT). An agroecosystem simulation model WNMM was used to understand factors controlling yield, AE(N), gaseous N emissions, and nitrate leaching in the region. Simulated AE(N) in the Yaqui Valley was highly variable, and mean on-farm AE(N) was 44\% lower than trials with similar fertilization rates at CIMMYT. Variability in residual N supply was the most important factor determining simulated AE(N). Better split applications of N fertilizer led to almost a doubling of AE(N), increased profit, and reduced N pollution, and even larger improvements were possible with technologies that allow for direct measurement of soil N supply and plant N demand, such as site-specific nitrogen management.},

Nine sandy to silty soils from North-East Germany could clearly be distinguished from each other, with a relatively low heterogeneity in the community structure within the field replicates. There was a relationship between the soil parent material, i.e. different glacial and aeolian sediments, and the clustering of the profiles from different sites. A site-specific grouping of T-RFLP profiles was also found for the rhizosphere samples of the same field sites that were planted with potatoes. The branching of the rhizosphere profiles corresponded partly with the soil parent material, whereas the effect of the plant genotype was negligible. Selected terminal restriction fragments differing in their relative abundance within the nine soils were analyzed based on the cloning of the 16S rRNA genes of one soil sample. A high phylogenetic diversity observed to include Acidobacteria, Betapro-teobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Gemmatimonadetes. The assign-ment of three out of the seven selected terminal restriction fragments to members of Acidobacteria suggested that this group seems to participate frequently in the shifting of community structures that result from soil property changes.},

  issn = {00380717},
  abstract = {N2O is a potent greenhouse gas and plays an important role in the depletion of stratospheric ozone. Hence, many efforts are now geared toward quantifying and mitigating N2O emissions from soil in various ecosystems. This requires an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms and processes underlying N2O emissions, which has been methodologically challenging. Recently, it has been suggested that the intramolecular distribution of 15N in the N2O molecule (known as site preference or SP) can indicate which processes contribute to N2O fluxes. Here, we assess, through guidance by a framework of recommended validation steps, the suitability of SP to source partition N2O emitted from soils. In individual studies, significant effects of soil moisture content and soil type on SP values from soil-emitted N2O have been observed, supporting that SP could be a useful tool to source-partition N2O emitted from soil. While process-specific SP values based on pure culture studies have been used in isotope mixing and fractionation models to source partition N2O in environmental samples, effects of confounding factors such as unaccounted pathways, microbial community composition, process rate, and soil heterogeneity remain poorly quantified. This urges continued research to determine SP values for distinct N2O producing and consuming processes under controlled laboratory conditions for soils from a variety of ecosystems and environments. As mechanisms underlying N2O production and consumption are plentiful and complex, creation of large isotope databases should be complemented with the development of more advanced models that take into account ??15N and ??18O of precursors, variability of overall isotope effects, and bulk ??15N, ??18O, and SP of N2O, as well as traditional proxies such as soil moisture content and C and N availability. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Wetland ecosystems provide an optimum natural environment for the sequestration and long-term storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, yet are natural sources of greenhouse gases emissions, especially methane. We illustrate that most wetlands, when carbon sequestration is compared to methane emissions, do not have 25 times more CO2 sequestration than methane emissions; therefore, to many landscape managers and non specialists, most wetlands would be considered by some to be sources of climate warming or net radiative forcing. We show by dynamic modeling of carbon flux results from seven detailed studies by us of temperate and tropical wetlands and from 14 other wetland studies by others that methane emissions become unimportant within 300 years compared to carbon sequestration in wetlands. Within that time frame or less, most wetlands become both net carbon and radiative sinks. Furthermore, we estimate that the world's wetlands, despite being only about 5-8 \% of the terrestrial landscape, may currently be net carbon sinks of about 830 Tg/year of carbon with an average of 118 g-C m(-2) year(-1) of net carbon retention. Most of that carbon retention occurs in tropical/subtropical wetlands. We demonstrate that almost all wetlands are net radiative sinks when balancing carbon sequestration and methane emissions and conclude that wetlands can be created and restored to provide C sequestration and other ecosystem services without great concern of creating net radiative sources on the climate due to methane emissions.},

Neither root nor rhizosphere bacterial communities were affected by the extent of sun-flower domestication, but domestication did affect the composition of rhizosphere fungal communities. In particular, more modern sunflower strains had lower relative abundances of putative fungal pathogens. Seed-associated fungal communities strongly differed across strains, but several lines of evidence suggest that there is minimal vertical transmission of fungi from seeds to the adult plants. Our results indicate that plant-associated fungal communities are more strongly influenced by host genetic factors and plant breeding than bacterial communities, a finding that could influence strategies for optimizing microbial communities to improve crop yields.},

Recent studies are reviewed within a framework of three experimental approaches that are often used to study larger organisms: environmental treatment, common garden, and reciprocal transplant experiments. Although the composition of microorganisms cannot be easily manipulated in the field, applying these approaches to intact microbial communities can begin to tease apart the effects of microbial composition from environmental parameters on ecosystem functioning. The challenges in applying these approaches to microorganisms are highlighted and it is discussed how the experimental approach and duration affects a study's interpretation. In general, long-term environmental treatment experiments identify correlative relationships between microbial composition and ecosystem functioning, whereas short-term common garden experiments demonstrate that microbial composition influences ecosystem functioning. Finally, reciprocal transplants simultaneously test for interactive effects of the environment and composition on functioning. The studies reviewed provide evidence that, at least in some cases, microbial composition influences ecosystem functioning. It is concluded that whole-community experiments offer a way to test whether information about microbial composition will help predict ecosystem responses to global change.},

  title = {Future Productivity and Carbon Storage Limited by Terrestrial Nutrient Availability},
  volume = {8},
  issn = {1752-0894},
  abstract = {The size of the terrestrial sink remains uncertain. This uncertainty presents a challenge for projecting future climate-carbon cycle feedbacks(1-4). Terrestrial carbon storage is dependent on the availability of nitrogen for plant growth(5-8), and nitrogen limitation is increasingly included in global models(9-11). Widespread phosphorus limitation in terrestrial ecosystems(12) may also strongly regulate the global carbon cycle(13-15), but explicit considerations of phosphorus limitation in global models are uncommon(16). Here we use global state-of-the-art coupled carbon-climate model projections of terrestrial net primary productivity and carbon storage from 1860-2100; estimates of annual new nutrient inputs from deposition, nitrogen fixation, and weathering; and estimates of carbon allocation and stoichiometry to evaluate how simulated CO2 fertilization effects could be constrained by nutrient availability. We find that the nutrients required for the projected increases in net primary productivity greatly exceed estimated nutrient supply rates, suggesting that projected productivity increases may be unrealistically high. Accounting for nitrogen and nitrogen-phosphorus limitation lowers projected end-of-century estimates of net primary productivity by 19\% and 25\%, respectively, and turns the land surface into a net source of CO2 by 2100. We conclude that potential effects of nutrient limitation must be considered in estimates of the terrestrial carbon sink strength through the twenty-first century.},

  title = {Emissions of Nitrous Oxide from Arable Organic and Conventional Cropping Systems on Two Soil Types},
  volume = {136},
  issn = {01678809},
  abstract = {Conventional cropping systems rely on targeted short-term fertility management, whereas organic systems depend, in part, on long-term increase in soil fertility as determined by crop rotation and management. Such differences influence soil nitrogen (N) cycling and availability through the year. The main objective of this study was to compare nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil under winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) within three organic and one conventional cropping system that differed in type of fertilizer, presence of catch crops and proportion of N2-fixing crops. The study was replicated in two identical long-term crop rotation experiments on sandy loam soils under different climatic conditions in Denmark (Flakkebjerg-eastern Denmark and Foulum-western Denmark). The conventional rotation received 165-170 kg N ha-1 in the form of NH4NO3, while the organic rotations received 100-110 kg N ha-1 as pig slurry. For at least 11 months, as from September 2007, static chambers were used to measure N2O emissions at least twice every calendar month. Mean daily N2O emissions across the year ranged from 172 to 438 ??g N m-2 d-1 at Flakkebjerg, and from 173 to 250 ??g N m-2 d-1 at Foulum. A multiple linear regression analysis showed inter-seasonal variations in emissions (P  0.001), but annual N2O emissions from organic and conventional systems were not significantly different despite the lower N input in organic rotations. The annual emissions ranged from 54 to 137 mg N m-2, which corresponded to 0.5-0.8\% of the N applied in manure or mineral fertilizer. Selected soil attributes were monitored to support the interpretation of N2O emission patterns. A second multiple linear regression analysis with potential drivers of N2O emissions showed a negative response to soil temperature (P = 0.008) and percent water-filled pore space (WFPS) (P = 0.052) at Foulum. However, there were positive interactions of both factors with NO3-N, i.e., high N2O emissions occurred during periods when high soil nitrate levels coincided with high soil temperature (P = 0.016) or high soil water content (P = 0.056). A positive effect (P = 0.03) of soil temperature was identified at Flakkebjerg, but the number of soil samplings was limited. Effects of cropping system on N2O emissions were not observed. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  title = {Effects of Undersown Crops on Soil Mineral {{N}} and Grain Yield of Spring Barley},
  volume = {27},
  issn = {1161-0301},
  abstract = {Undersowing a cereal crop can reduce nitrogen (N) leaching and increase available N for the successive crop. An undersown crop can also compete with the main crop. Seventeen plant species were undersown in spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) to study their suitability regarding establishment, biomass production, competition with the main crop and effects on soil mineral N. Three different seeding rates were evaluated. Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) decreased nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) content in late autumn and timothy (Phleum pratense L.) in the succeeding spring. A mixture was optimal to reduce N leaching. Italian ryegrass is a very competitive species that should be undersown at moderate seeding rates to avoid large yield reduction in the main crop. Black medic (Medicago lupulina L.) slightly increased N leaching risk, but red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) did not increase soil NO3-N content. As clovers did not compete strongly with the main crop, fairly high seeding rates can be used to maximise N fixation to benefit the successive crop.},
