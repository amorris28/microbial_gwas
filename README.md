## Data

`raw_data/` contains raw data as received from colleagues. This is never modified,
but is under version control.

`output/` is where modified data files are saved. These are not version
controlled and she be recreated from source.

`talapas-output/` is where model output from the talapas HPC cluster.

`Figures/` contains figures output from scripts

`Tables/` contains tables output from scripts

`R/` Contains scripts that run plus helper functions

## Scripts

### R
`R/` directory contains `R` scripts that run.

`0_setup.R` has code to install all required packages.

`1_clean_sample_data.R` takes in the raw sample date file and munges it for analysis.

`2_clean_asvs.R` takes in the raw ASV table and munges it for analysis including

`3_geodist_processing.R` takes in the raw GPS data and converts it to meters using
UTM.

`4_var_stab_transform.R` performs the `varianceStabilizingTransformation` from `DESeq2`.

`5_combine_data.R` pulls in the asvs, sample data, and GPS data and combines them
into a single data structure.

`6_var_comp.R` is the script that fits variance component models from the raw
data. This is typically submitted to the cluster and the output from the cluster is
`scp`ed into `talapas-output/`.

`7_analysis.R` is the primary file that presents the results and creates the
figures and tables.

`functions.R` contains holds the user-made functions specific to this project.

### Manuscript
`manuscript/` directory contains `.tex` files to compile the manuscript

`ecology.bst` is the Ecology journal bibliography style file.

`latexmkrc` removes margins for easier viewing of the PDF on computers. This can
be renamed or removed to return to normal `latex` formatting.

`library.bib` is the bibliography file.

`main.tex` contains the manuscript text.

### Tables and Figures
These directories are not version controlled. They should always we able to be
recreated from source.
`tables/` is where tables are saved from `R` and imported to `latex`
`figures/` is where figures are saved from `R` and imported to `latex`
